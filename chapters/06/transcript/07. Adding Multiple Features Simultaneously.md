0:02 You can open multiple sessions with Claude

0:04 Code to work on many features in parallel.

0:08 To manage these sessions and make sure you're not

0:11 overwriting the same file, you can use Git worktrees.

0:14 So let's add Git worktrees to add

0:16 three features to the chatbot in parallel.

0:19 I'll see you there. So I'm going to hop back into Claude.

0:21 And as we saw earlier, Claude Code comes built in

0:24 with quite a few slash commands.

0:27 But you can also make your

0:28 own. To make your own custom commands,

0:29 inside of the dot claude folder.

0:32 Let's make a new folder called commands.

0:34 And inside of here, we're going to make a markdown file

0:38 with the name of the command that we'd like.

![截图：/implement-feature 命令](https://poketto.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/c332e0100fc758372c9b7fa1453b81bc.png?x-oss-process=image/quality,q_90/rotate,0)


```markdown
You will be imp lementing a new feature in this codebase

$ARGUMENTS

IMPORTANT: Only do this for front-end features，
Once this feature is built, make sure to write the changes you made to file called frontend-changes.md
Do not ask for permissions to modify this file， assume you can always do it.
```

0:40 The command here that I'm going to make is called implement feature.

0:44 So I'll create a markdown file called implement-feature.md

0:48 Inside here, I can place whatever I'd like.

0:51 But what I want to show you that's very special

0:54 is if you have any arguments you

0:56 want to pass to your custom command, you can reference it using

1:01 this $ARGUMENTS variable.

1:03 So what I'm asking for here

1:04 is that when this command is used,

1:06 I'll be specifying that you're implementing a new feature.

1:09 The user can then specify whatever that feature is,

1:13 and then I want to make

1:14 sure that Claude Code is well aware

1:15 to only do this for front-end features,

1:18 and to write the changes made to a file called frontend-changes.md

1:22 You can imagine there are many different use cases for custom commands,

1:26 certain ways you want to run tests or run files.

1:29 and anything that you put in here

1:31 does not automatically get added to your context,

1:34 unlike a CLAUDE.md

1:36 So if you want something to be applied

1:39 to every single instance of Claude Code that you make,

1:42 use your CLAUDE.md file.

1:44 But if you just have specific commands

1:46 that you may or may not use across different conversations,

1:50 right here is a great place to put them.

1:52 I'm going to be using this custom command

1:54 when I start talking about worktrees.

1:56 But before we do that, let's quit out of Claude Code,

1:59 hop back in and just verify

2:01 that we can see that custom command.

2:04 And here, I see implement feature, and I see the description

2:07 is coming from the first part of this markdown file.

2:10 Now that I've added this custom command,

2:13 let's go ahead and add and commit it.

2:15 I could do this from the command line,

2:17 but I'm actually going to ask Claude to do that for me.

![截图：让 cc 自己 commit](https://poketto.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/a6f23a05365d18543e84acde475113ea.png?x-oss-process=image/quality,q_90/rotate,0)


2:20 **Add and commit changes made**.


```markdown
add and commit changes made
```

```ad-note

感觉老师的这条自动 commit prompt 还是挺有用的，记一下 ：**Add and commit changes made**。

考虑到我们经常需要自动commit，所以封装成一个 slash command 会更好，具体见我们附录中基于手工川meta command 生成的手工川 git-add-commit command。

话说去年年末的时候，我有花一整个月时间打磨了一款自动 commit 工具，叫 [oh-my-commit](https://github.com/oh-my-commit/oh-my-commit)，它同时支持命令行和vscode两种环境，默认使用 [Convertional Commits Style](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)。

当时花了很多时间在研究怎么在vscode插件里的webview里做好UIUX，没想到很快就进入了基于cc无界面的vibe coding时代，慢慢就没怎么用了。

但一个好的、快速的、适合自己的commit系统（尤其是与CICD集成的时候），个人觉得依旧是有价值的，所以我后续可能会考虑进一步优化其支持 slash command、hook、mcp等。
```

2:22 This is nice so that Claude Code can create

2:24 a nice commit message

2:26 with some descriptive information for what was done.

2:29 We'll see that it's adding the .claude folder

2:31 and committing with the commands necessary.

2:34 We can see here that this has been added to the repository.

2:37 And since we've granted permissions for this already,

2:40 we don't have to respond again.

2:42 If you're ever curious where that lives,

2:44 inside of the claude folder,

2:46 there is a settings.local.json file

2:49 Inside of this file, we can specify

2:52 what commands we've allowed so that we don't need

2:54 to confirm every single time.

![截图：配置放行命令](https://poketto.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/b915e36af835640c4c2f8585402b2a58.png?x-oss-process=image/quality,q_90/rotate,0)


2:57 As you can see here, as well,

2:58 when we use playwright, we gave permissions.

3:00 And if you'd like to add your own,

3:02 you can easily do so in this file,

3:04 or even with the handy /permissions command.

3:08 Now that we've got that custom command set up,

3:10 let's talk a little bit about how we

3:12 might want to work in parallel with Claude Code.

3:14 Instead of just opening up multiple terminal

3:17 windows and working directly on this code base,

3:20 we're going to use Git to make sure

3:23 that we don't overwrite existing files when we have

3:27 multiple instances of Claude Code.

3:29 I might have two different instances of

3:31 Claude Code operating on the same file.

3:34 And if I do that with

3:35 the environment that I'm in right now,

3:37 there's going to be overwriting, bug

3:39 creation and quite a bit of confusion.

3:42 Thankfully, Git has an excellent option here

3:44 to use a feature called worktrees.

3:46 And worktrees allow me to essentially create copies of the codebase,

3:51 operate in isolation,

3:53 and then at the end, merge those in together. And in fact,

3:57 I can use Claude to help with that merging

4:00 and management of my worktrees.

4:02 To get started with worktrees,

4:03 I'm going to first make a folder called .trees

4:06 And inside of this worktrees folder,

4:09 I'm going to go ahead and add a couple worktrees.

4:12 Let's add a work tree using the Git worktree add command.

4:15 and then we'll specify the folder as well

4:19 as the name of the work tree that I want to add.

4:21 We'll call this one ui\_feature. We'll

4:23 then go ahead and add another one

4:26 called testing\_feature,

4:27 and then finally a third one called quality\_feature.

4:31 To confirm I've created all of these, I can take a look

4:35 and I can see that I'm on the main branch currently

4:37 and that I've created three separate worktrees.

![截图：新建三个worktrees](https://poketto.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/4bcbff02f81316d00dfbead4f0fcfcfe.png?x-oss-process=image/quality,q_90/rotate,0)



```bash
$ git worktree add . trees/ui_feature
Preparing worktree （checking out 'ui_feature"）
HEAD is now at f81b935 L5

$ git worktree add .trees/testing_feature
Preparing worktree （checking out ' testing_feature"）
HEAD is now at f81b935 L5

$ git worktree add . trees/quality_feature
Preparing worktree （checking out 'quality_feature"）
HEAD is now at f81b935 L5

$ git branch -a
* main
+ quality_feature
testing_feature
ui feature
remotes/origin/main
```

4:40 To set up correctly in each of these environments,

4:43 I'm going to open up the trees folder,

4:46 and I'm going to open up

4:47 a terminal for each one of them.

4:49 I'll start with my ui\_feature and bring that over here.

4:53 I'll then go ahead, bring in my testing feature,

4:55 and I'll move that right to the side.

4:57 Finally, let's bring in our quality\_feature.

4:59 Go ahead, bring that over up here.

5:02 To give us a little more

5:04 room, we'll make this a bit smaller.

5:05 And now we have three dedicated terminal windows.

5:08 And we'll hide the explorer as well.

5:10 Now, let's open up Claude for each one of these environments.

5:14 What we can do now is run Claude Code in parallel and

5:18 make sure that if the same files are modified, we're not overwriting

5:23 and we can fix that later

5:24 when we merge in these worktrees.

5:26 I'm going to use this implement-feature command.

5:29 And then I'm going to put in

5:31 a particular feature that I'd like here.

5:33 And that feature allows me to add a

5:36 toggle button to switch between dark and light themes.

5:38 So let's go ahead and create a toggle button, position it,

5:42 and make sure that I can navigate for this particular toggle button.

5:46 We'll start with this part and

5:47 then add in the light theme variant.


```markdown
>/implement-feature Toggle Button Design
- Create a toggle button that fits the existing design aesthetic
- Position it in the top-right
- Use an icon-based design （sun/ moon icons or similar）
- Smooth transition animation when toggling
- Button should be accessible and keyboard-navigable
```


5:49 While this is running, I can now move to another work tree.

5:53 And in this second work tree, let's start thinking

5:55 a little bit about what I

5:57 want to do for this testing framework.

5:58 going to pass in a prompt here to enhance

6:01 the existing testing framework and add additional tests for FastAPI endpoints.



```markdown
Enhance the existing testing framework for the RAG system in @backend/ tests. The current tests cover unit components but are missing essential API testing infrastructure：

- API endpoint tests - Test the FastAPI endpoints （/api/query, Fapi/courses, /） for proper request/ response handling 
- pytest configuration - Add pytest.ini_options in pyproject.toml for cleaner test execution
- Test fixtures - Create conftest.py with shared fixtures for mocking and test data setup

The FastAPI app in backend/app.py mounts static files that don 't exist in the test environment. Either create a separate test app or define the API endpoints inline in the test file to avoid import issues.
```



```ad-note

仅有第一个 worktree 使用了 /implement-feature （可能是老师觉得后面两个需求不属于功能性需求，或者没有特别重要，或者也可能是他忘了:）
```

6:06 While that's going, let's add some essential

6:08 code quality tools to our development workflow.

```markdown
Add essential code quality tools to the deve Lopment workf Low. Set up black for
automatic code formatting. Add proper formatting consistency throughout the codebase and create deve Lopment scripts for running quality checks.
```


6:11 As we do this, we can start

6:13 to see that changes are being requested.

![截图：三个worktrees均已开始工作](https://poketto.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/078b22a842001d4eee02d25b4d5603c4.png?x-oss-process=image/quality,q_90/rotate,0)


6:15 So let's go ahead and shift between these

6:17 environments and confirm the changes that

6:19 we want. Our tests are being written

6:21 and our additional development dependencies for analyzing

6:25 code base structure and formatting are being added as well.

6:28 What we're going to see here

6:30 is that we're modifying a file called pyproject.toml

6:33 And we're also going to see that there's a request being added

6:37 to edit that particular file as well.

6:40 As we continue these options

6:42 will make edits to these files,

6:44 and we'll go ahead and see at the same time

6:46 that our front end code is being done as expected.

6:48 We can work in parallel and make sure

6:51 that none of these particular changes are being overwritten by

6:55 other parts of the codebase. If there happen

6:57 to be changes that we've made to similar files,

6:59 we can ensure that those merge conflicts are fixed.

7:02 and we can do that using Claude.

7:04 Our front-end changes are being written,

7:06 we're adding more tests, and we're adding some

7:08 formatting tools and development scripts for quality checks.

7:12 So we're going to proceed as expected,

7:13 making sure that quality scripts are being done,

7:16 and it looks like our front-end features are being added.

7:19 Now, add that light theme,

7:21 the same way that we did previously. We'll use our implement feature,

7:24 custom command to make sure we're writing that to our change log.

7:28 and we'll add a light theme as

7:29 well. Once that's done, we'll go ahead and

7:31 cue up a few other prompts we'd like

7:34 for JavaScript functionality and implementation details.

7:36 So while that's running, I can check in on other scripts.

7:39 I can confirm I want to run those,

7:41 and if there's something going on, Claude Code can fix per necessary.

7:45 Seems like there are some scripts that Claude doesn't know about,

7:48 so we'll go ahead and either install dependencies

7:50 or make sure we're running things as expected.

7:53 You can see here, we're starting from code quality checks.

7:55 We've written our API endpoint testing and we're adding more

7:59 front end functionality. Once this is all

8:01 done, we can head over to the browser.

8:03 We can confirm our checks are done,

8:04 but before we go ahead and do that,

8:07 let's bring in all of these individual changes.

8:09 If we wanted to run the tests,

8:11 we can confirm this is as expected.

8:13 We want to head to the browser

8:14 for our UI testing, we can do so.

8:16 And here we can see Codebase formatting is done, Development scripts have

8:19 been added, and documentation has been

8:21 updated. We saw before there was a

8:24 the pyproject.toml file that was added across two different worktrees.

8:27 So there might be some conflicts when figuring out these individual pieces.

8:31 Now that we feel good about each

8:33 of these changes, let's add and commit with a descriptive message.

8:37 Let's also do the same thing on this work tree.

8:39 Since we're going to be merging in these particular commits,

8:42 we're going to want to make sure we have descriptive commit messages

8:44 we can understand what was done in each of these worktrees.

8:47 We've committed this particular commit,

8:50 we're doing the same on this one right here.

8:52 We finished up our UI enhancement. So let's do the same.

8:55 add and commit with a descriptive message.

8:58 If you find yourself writing these kinds of

9:00 prompts like add and commit with a descriptive message,

9:02 this also could be another use case for

9:04 a nice custom command where we can specify

9:07 exactly some styling that we want or the

9:09 way that our company operates with best Git practices.

9:11 Now that I finished committing across all three of these,

9:14 I can now go back to my

9:16 main branch and merge some things in.

9:18 So I'm going to close these terminal

9:19 environments and hop back to our main one.

9:22 So now I'm going to ask Claude...

9:23 To use the Git merge command

9:26 to merge in all of the worktrees in the .trees folder

9:30 and fix any conflicts if there are any.

9:33 So let's have Claude Code merge all of these particular trees

9:37 and make sure that they work as expected.

![截图：让 cc merge 所有 features](https://poketto.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/0a70328439d019c2235153919fc35b09.png?x-oss-process=image/quality,q_90/rotate,0)


9:39 We can see here there are three worktrees available.

9:41 So we're going to start by merging in each of these worktrees.

9:44 We'll confirm this is the command we want to use,

9:47 and then this should work as expected.

9:49 Looks like our testing feature doesn't have any conflicts.

9:52 Let's bring on our UI feature.

9:54 And again, we could write these commands on our own,

9:56 but Claude Code knows exactly what to do from our prompt.

9:59 Now we can merge in the quality feature branch.

10:01 And here we'll see if there are any conflicts.

10:04 and as we can see, in this particular file, there are conflicts.

10:08 So what we're going to have Claude Code do

10:10 is analyze these conflicts and complete the merge.

10:12 This can be quite valuable when you have small merge conflicts

10:15 that you don't want to manually go through each time.

10:18 Having tests here is also quite valuable

10:20 to make sure that once we've finished, we could

10:22 run our tests and the code base works as expected.

10:25 It's now continuing with the merge as expected.

10:27 and it's going to commit all of

10:29 these changes with the resolved merge conflicts.

![截图：cc自动处理merge冲突](https://poketto.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/baf727d0751c3518001b1747b6c0bde6.png?x-oss-process=image/quality,q_90/rotate,0)


10:31 If I'd like after, I can ask for it to remove

10:34 these worktrees or I can keep them there if I need.

10:36 So I'll do a quick test to

10:38 make sure that these files are here

10:40 as expected and that the merge configurations

10:41 are what are expected here as well.

10:43 We can also head back to the browser and

10:46 see if our front end changes are implemented as expected.

10:48 Looks like Claude Code has finished up, we've added necessary dependencies,

10:52 we've modified our pyproject.toml

10:54 We've added tests.

10:56 we've implemented the light dark themes.

10:58 We've implemented our black code formatter

11:01 to make sure that code is as expected in a certain format.

11:04 and added that configuration in the same file

11:06 that we worked on with another work tree.

11:09 We fixed up any conflicts.

![截图：cc已经处理完所有任务](https://poketto.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/a822e67a59571678f802b8d2b8fa3760.png?x-oss-process=image/quality,q_90/rotate,0)


11:11 Let's make sure this is working

11:12 as expected. So back in the browser,

11:14 I now see here, I have this lovely theme

11:17 and as I toggle through, I can

11:19 see a light theme and a dark theme.

![截图：确认前端的主题切换功能已经实现](https://poketto.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/8e1b87bda460a952b95cfccc212159c4.png?x-oss-process=image/quality,q_90/rotate,0)


11:21 So there might be some more things

11:22 I want to tweak here and there,

11:24 but I've been able to edit across all parts of the stack,

11:27 even do things in the linting and DevOps side of things,

11:32 all without overwriting,

11:34 causing challenging headaches through the power of Git worktrees.

11:37 In the next lesson, we're going to see how

11:40 we can use Claude Code outside of the terminal

11:42 through an integration with GitHub to allow for reviewing pull requests,

11:47 making changes and being helpful outside of the terminal ecosystem.

allowed-tools: [Bash(git:*), Read(*), Grep(*), LS(*)]
description: Add and commit with conventional style
version: "1.0.1"
author: "公众号：手工川"

# Intelligent Git Commit Command

You are creating a git commit with the following features:
- **Default language**: Chinese (中文) for commit messages
- **Conventional Commit style**: Use conventional commit format (type(scope): description)
- **User context integration**: Accept and incorporate user-provided additional context

## Configuration Settings

    default_language: "zh-CN"
    commit_style: "conventional"
    types:
      - feat: 新功能
      - fix: 修复bug
      - docs: 文档更新
      - style: 代码格式调整
      - refactor: 重构
      - perf: 性能优化
      - test: 测试相关
      - build: 构建系统
      - ci: CI/CD配置
      - chore: 其他更改
      - revert: 回滚提交

## Workflow

1. **Analyze current changes**:
   - Run `git status` to check for uncommitted changes
   - Run `git diff --cached` to see staged changes
   - Run `git diff` to see unstaged changes
   - Identify the main type of changes and affected scope

2. **Parse user input**:
   - Check if user provided additional context or specific requirements
   - Extract any specific commit type or scope preferences
   - Consider any attention points mentioned by the user

3. **Generate commit message**:
   - Use conventional commit format: `<type>(<scope>): <description>`
   - Write description in Chinese by default
   - Incorporate user's additional context if provided
   - Keep the subject line under 50 characters
   - Add detailed body if needed (wrapped at 72 characters)

4. **Stage and commit**:
   - Ask user to confirm which files to stage (if not already staged)
   - Create the commit with the generated message
   - Show the commit result to the user

## Example Usage

When the user runs `/git-add-commit`, you should:

1. First check the git status and changes
2. Analyze what type of changes were made
3. Generate an appropriate conventional commit message in Chinese
4. If the user provided additional context like "注意性能优化部分", incorporate it
5. Create the commit

## Important Notes

- Always analyze the TARGET directory where the command is run
- Do NOT assume anything about the current directory structure
- Support both staged and unstaged changes
- Allow user to override language or commit style if specified
- Ensure commit messages are meaningful and descriptive

## User Input Parameters

The user can provide additional context in several ways:
- Direct description: Additional text after `/git-add-commit`
- Type override: Specify a different commit type
- Language override: Request English or other language
- Scope specification: Define a specific scope for the commit

Generate appropriate conventional commit messages based on the actual changes in the target repository.
