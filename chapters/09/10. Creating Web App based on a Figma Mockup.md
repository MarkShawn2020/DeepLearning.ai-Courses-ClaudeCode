Transcript

0:02 In this last

0:03 lesson, you'll connect Claude to the Figma MCP server

0:06 to import a design mockup to Claude Code and develop the application.

0:10 Let's have some fun.

0:11 Now that we've seen how to use Claude Code to get up to speed on code bases

0:16 to create applications and work across many different environments,

0:20 I want to showcase a really powerful ability for Claude Code

0:23 to work alongside MCP servers, to take mockups from tools like Figma

0:29 and turn them into web applications quickly.

0:32 In order to do that.

0:33 We're going to be making use of the Figma MCP server.

0:36 And in order to do that, you will need a Figma account.

0:39 We'll also provide an alternative if you want to use that

0:42 without subscribing to Figma as dev mode.

0:45 We're also going to be using our Playwright MCP server,

0:49 so that we can analyze a mock up from Figma, generate the necessary HTML

0:54 and then programmatically test that by opening it in the browser

0:58 and taking screenshots of how best to interact with this application.

1:02 Since I'm building a front end application with a more modern technology

1:06 stack, I'm going to be using Next.js to do that.

1:09 So I'm just going to start by creating a Next.js application

1:13 with the latest version inside of the folder that I'm in.

1:17 I'll follow most of these same defaults, and I'll go ahead

1:20 and let it install the necessary dependencies.

1:23 If you have not worked with Next.js before, that's more than fine.

1:26 It's a couple of command line commands and then will be in the browser

1:29 before you know it.

1:30 While this is installing, let's go take a look at the mockup that we have in Figma.

1:35 In Figma,

1:36 I have a mock right here for a dashboard that I'd like

1:39 to build using Federal Reserve Economic data.

1:42 This mock right here in Figma is not the most detailed in terms

1:46 of all the layers

1:47 and all the analytics behind, but this is enough to get me started.

1:51 What I'm going to do in Figma is first, make sure that I have gone

1:55 to preferences and selected enable dev mode MCP server.

![目标 figma 工程界面](https://poketto.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/cb9d9eb09861263dbd5542a385d3bb1f.png?x-oss-process=image/quality,q_90/rotate,0)


1:59 Once I have that selected, I'm going to take this particular layer

2:03 that I have and copy it because I'm going to need

2:05 that when I specify what to use with the MCP server.

2:09 Now that I've successfully created this Next.js application, we need to add

2:13 to Claude the two MCP servers that I want to use for Figma and for Playwright.

2:18 I'm going to go ahead and add the necessary

2:20 command here to bring in the MCP server for Figma.

2:24 And then I'll do the same for Playwright.

2:27 So I'm going to add an MCP server for Playwright,

2:30 and that is started locally using the following command.

2:33 And even though we already added this, remember

2:36 we're in a separate project and a separate environment.

2:39 So this does not get applied to every single Claude Code application I built.

2:44 We have to do this for each one to make sure I've done this correctly.

![项目增加 figma mcp](https://poketto.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/d37d4cb2df691c89b2d45e80415c2b3a.png?x-oss-process=image/quality,q_90/rotate,0)


2:47 I'm going to hop into Claude and I'm going to use the slash MCP command

2:51 to make sure this looks good.

2:52 If I take a look, I can see that both of these are connected.

![查看 mcp 列表](https://poketto.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/76c4e9ced5fc43f785f985853d074d3d.png?x-oss-process=image/quality,q_90/rotate,0)


2:55 And if I take a look at the dev mode MCP server, I can see

2:58 there are five tools available to get underlying code, to get an image,

3:03 to get design rules around a particular mock up that I have in Figma.

3:08 Now that we've connected to both of our MCP servers,

3:11 let's go and ask Claude to use the following Figma mockup

3:14 and the Figma MCP server to analyze and build the underlying code necessary.

3:19 We'll ask it to use the recharge library for creating charts,

3:22 and then we'll check how this application looks using the Playwright MCP server.

![prompt：cc + figma-mcp](https://poketto.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/02da78ebb7f6464bd44e8219fc9ae94f.png?x-oss-process=image/quality,q_90/rotate,0)


3:31 But before I do this, I want to go ahead and make a quick change.

3:35 If you are able to make this change and you're

3:38 not on the pro plan, you can use Opus as a different model.

3:41 If not, Sonnet will still do a fine job, but Opus will do

3:44 slightly better for a little bit more of a complex task.

3:47 Once I have switched to that model,

3:49 let's go ahead and run our prompt and see how it does.

3:52 Well, first need to connect to our MCP servers.

3:55 Make sure we use the correct mock up and the tools necessary

3:58 to read the underlying code to power this mock.

4:01 Here we can see we're using the Get image tool from the Figma dev MCP server,

4:05 followed by the Get Code tool to get the underlying code behind that

4:09 mock. We'll then make sure we install

4:11 the necessary dependencies using npm or the package manager.

4:15 And here we're going to see it's not installed.

4:17 So Claude Code is most likely going to ask us to install that.

4:20 We'll do so and continue onwards.

4:22 Since we're inside of this Next.js application.

4:25 We're going to be doing the majority of the work in the app folder.

4:28 We'll analyze any global CSS and here start creating the main dashboard

4:33 structure. Here we're going to add a little bit of metadata.

![cc 正在修改网站meta信息](https://poketto.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/63056053e2f333f7bbee1a4feeb613a6.png?x-oss-process=image/quality,q_90/rotate,0)


4:35 And this looks good.

4:37 So for future edits I'll just let Claude go ahead and run those.

4:40 We're now going to create the dashboard layout

4:42 and build this with more of a component based architecture in react.

4:46 Now that we've created the underlying structure, let's start to make sure things

4:49 look as expected.

4:50 And since I've already run the server here, I'm just going to say

4:54 don't run the server.

4:55 It's already running. Continue on.

4:57 We're now going to test with Playwright and take a look at how things are.

5:00 We'll go ahead and navigate to localhost 3000.

5:03 Take a picture of that as well.

5:04 And let's go ahead and let it take a screenshot.

5:05 We can see here in Playwright.

5:07 So far it's looking pretty good compared to the mock.

5:10 We've got a little extra styling on some of these bars,

5:12 but this is a pretty good start from where we began with the mock right over here.

5:16 In fact, I'd actually argue this looks a little bit nicer.

![cc 已经复刻了目标 figma（甚至效果更好）](https://poketto.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/bea5dbd2f2da2faa8bdb70a9aa414140.png?x-oss-process=image/quality,q_90/rotate,0)


5:20 We're still going to see some changes that are being made.

5:22 There's a layout in the sidebar

5:23 that needs to be modified, and we can always have Claude

5:26 go back and forth and iterate across this particular mock.

5:29 One important thing to mention is that this mock in Figma does

5:32 not have a tremendous amount of layers and underlying components.

5:36 So a lot of this is going to depend on the quality of the underlying mock

5:40 that you have.

5:41 But this is a really good start with very minimal amount of time.

5:44 We can see here what's been built and what's closely matching.

5:47 Now let's take a look at how things are.

5:49 We can see with a little bit of work from the model and using MCP servers

5:52 to verify visualizations and build off our mocks.

5:56 Things that might have taken days to do and build from scratch

5:59 can be done over the course of minutes.

6:01 So you might be wondering what comes next here.

6:03 This mock that we have is just the start of what you might imagine building.

6:08 And this data is actually available through an API.

6:12 So I could ask Claude Code, populate these charts

6:15 with real world data from the Federal Reserve Economic data.

6:19 We'll go ahead and ask Claude Code to use one of its web search

6:22 tools to go ahead and find information to update with actual data.

6:27 Here we'll look at CPI, unemployment yields and so on.

6:31 But you can imagine this might be data that you're fetching from a back end.

6:35 But here we're going to showcase Claude's ability to research

6:38 how to work with the API documentation how to fetch data.

6:42 And it might be possible that we need an API key to do so.

6:45 So as we start doing some of this research, Claude is going to let us know

6:48 what we need to make sure things are working as expected. In that mock,

6:53 there were a couple other

6:54 pieces in the nav bar that were just meant for visualizations,

6:58 but we can add whatever underlying functionality we want next.

7:01 So after it's done some research, it realizes that in order for me

7:05 to fetch actual data from the Federal Reserve,

7:08 I'm going to need to put in an API key.

7:11 I can go ahead to my account, get an API key.

![确认 Fred API Key](https://poketto.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/3f89175ee96e84813134ef8ddaae2fd6.png?x-oss-process=image/quality,q_90/rotate,0)


7:16 This is a relatively simple process that you can see here.

7:19 Once I have my API key, it's going to start writing

7:22 additional code for me to fetch data and display data visually.

7:27 So I'm going to go ahead and update my API key inside of here.

7:35 Now that I've updated the API key, let's see where cloud is at

7:39 with building additional data.

![在本地环境变量中更新 API Key](https://poketto.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/1228d82156b824e7d1651e7ca23fb3d8.png?x-oss-process=image/quality,q_90/rotate,0)


7:41 It's now written a service to fetch economic data.

7:44 We're now going to update the dashboard and fetch real data using our API.

7:56 We're going to test this in Playwright.

7:57 And we're going to go ahead and then take a look at what we have in the browser.

8:00 We'll go see how this looks visually.

8:02 And if there's any underlying code that needs to be modified to make

8:05 this more visually appealing,

8:17 with just a little bit of prompting,

8:18 we can go from a mock with some fake data

8:21 to actually using real world information across a true data source for this data.

8:26 When we're done, we'll head back to localhost 3000.

8:29 Take a look at what we have and see that the data

8:31 that we'll be fetching is not something that's actually fictitious,

8:35 but real unemployment, ten year treasuries and so on.

8:38 We set up quite a bit here

8:39 to proxy our requests and quite a few more interactive features.

8:43 So let's go see what that looks like.

8:45 We've gone from our mock here with some fake data

8:48 and not a lot of functionality to something quite powerful.

8:51 In just a short period of time.

8:52 The data we're loading here has data that is actually reflective

8:56 of real world information.

8:58 And as we imagine adding more functionality,

9:01 we can tab through for what this will look like.

9:03 But with just a small amount of work with an MCP server pulling data

9:07 from real world environments and building UI from Figma mocks,

9:11 you can start to imagine how quickly front end development can go,

9:15 especially for building powerful real world interfaces.

9:18 You might want to verify that this data is actually coming from the source,

9:22 and we built that here with this detailed functionality.

9:25 So we can easily see where this data is coming from, what things look like,

9:30 and track that back to the dashboards that we're building as well.

9:33 So right here we're just showing some key indicators.

9:36 But maybe the next thing I want to do is start building my own interface or use

9:40 another Figma mark for things like inflation, employment and so on.

9:44 So we'll start with this piece of data, but I'd love to see what else

9:47 you can build using this interface and all the data at your fingertips.
