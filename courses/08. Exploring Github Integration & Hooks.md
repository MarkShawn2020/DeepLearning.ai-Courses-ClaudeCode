Transcript

0:02 In this lesson, you'll learn how to use Claude

0:05 Code outside of the terminal with a GitHub integration.

0:08 You'll see how to set up Claude Code

0:11 to review pull requests and fix issues in GitHub.

0:14 You'll then learn how to execute code before

0:17 and after using tools through Claude Code hooks. Let's dive in.

0:21 We left off in the last section merging our wortrees together,

0:25 but we forgot to ask Claude to remove those worktrees.

0:28 So we're going to hop back into Claude. So

0:30 I'm going to go and pass in the resume flag

0:32 to go back to a previous

0:35 conversation that I had with my worktrees.

0:38 In this particular conversation, we can now

0:40 go back to where we were before

0:42 and finish up with removing our worktrees.

0:45 So let's ask Claude, remove the .trees folder

0:47 and the underlying worktrees, and once you're done,

0:50 push this code to GitHub. So

0:52 let's go ahead and give Claude Code

0:54 a second to run the necessary git commands

0:56 to remove that folder and then pushed our merge code

0:59 to GitHub. We'll go ahead and give Claude Code access to

1:03 see the underlying worktrees so that we not only

1:05 remove the worktrees,

1:08 but also delete the corresponding branches.

1:11 We'll go ahead and remove these particular trees.

1:14 now remove the directory and then remove the underlying branches.

1:17 Now that we've done that, let's go ahead

1:19 make sure that worked as expected, which is good.

1:21 we don't have that folder. And

1:23 now, let's push this code to GitHub.

1:25 We'll confirm that we want to

1:26 run the git push origin main command

1:28 and it looks like our code is pushed to GitHub.

1:31 Now that we've committed and pushed our code to GitHub,

1:34 let's start installing the GitHub integration that comes with Claude Code.

1:38 I'll do that using the /install-GitHub-app command.

1:42 Here you might see that you need to

1:44 include additional authentication using the command line interface.

1:48 So if you see those setup instructions, make sure to follow them.

1:51 We'll now be able to install the GitHub

1:54 app for the current repository that we're working in.

1:56 So let's go ahead and do

1:58 that. This will open up the browser.

1:59 And if I have not yet configured

2:01 this, I'll have the option to install.

2:04 What this integration allows us to do is use Claude Code

2:07 in pull requests and issues

2:09 to respond to feedback, fix errors,

2:12 modify code, and much more.

2:15 In order for this functionality to exist,

2:17 it's built on top of the software development kit

2:19 that comes with Claude Code. This SDK allows you

2:23 to use Claude Code outside

2:25 of the terminal interface. So let's head back to the terminal.

2:29 specify the workflows we want to install.

2:32 These workflows allow for tagging Claude in issues

2:35 and using Claude to automatically review code in our pull requests.

2:40 Let's install both. We'll create a long-lived token.

2:44 and here we'll have to authorize and authenticate with Claude.

2:48 Once that's done, we can head back

2:49 and we'll see that it's creating the repository information,

2:53 setting up any additional information I need,

2:55 and sending me right back to GitHub

2:57 to open a pull request.

2:59 with the changes that had been made.

3:01 We can see here automatically,

3:03 this pull request allows for GitHub Actions

3:06 to enable bug fixes, writing tests and code reviews.

3:10 We can change this if we like,

3:11 or we can go ahead and create a pull request

3:14 with the default information. In this pull request, we can see

3:18 that not only have we created

3:20 a YAML file for Claude to operate,

3:23 we also have one for code reviews.

3:24 Here we can see out of the

3:26 box, we have some pretty sane defaults. We can filter

3:29 by authors, we can specify what this is running on.

3:32 But out of the box, we get

3:33 quite a bit of really nice functionality.

3:35 If you'd like to modify the prompt

3:36 that you have in your code review, you can do that here.

3:40 And since this is a file that is tracked by git,

3:42 you can constantly edit this if you need.

3:45 I'm going to go ahead now and merge this in,

3:47 so we can start using Claude Code in GitHub.

3:50 We can go ahead and see right out of

3:52 the box that a Claude GitHub action has actually started.

3:54 This is what we're going to see out

3:56 of the box in our future pull requests.

3:58 It's going to read and analyze files, check code quality,

4:01 identify security considerations, and out of the box,

4:05 we now have a new teammate, Claude,

4:07 to check the work that we

4:08 and our other team members are doing.

4:10 This sometimes takes a little bit of

4:11 time to start, but once this has finished,

4:13 we'll get some detailed assessments from Claude,

4:15 and we'll be able to merge in the pull request

4:17 when we're ready. So it looks like the review is done,

4:19 and depending on the prompt that we give it, we can specify

4:23 how much depth and information we want here.

4:25 We see some things that are working well,

4:27 maybe some considerations that we

4:29 you may need. And if this looks good to us,

4:31 we can merge in that pull request. Now

4:33 we're going to see out of the box,

4:35 in future pull requests, Claude will help review our code.

4:37 This is really helpful when humans might miss certain things

4:41 and you need an extra step to check

4:43 that what you have is working as expected.

4:45 Let's imagine there's a situation where an issue comes up.

4:48 Someone on our team decides to add a new issue.

4:50 We could do this in GitHub, we

4:52 could even do this in Claude Code.

4:54 As you might have noticed, as we kept building on

4:56 top of this application, we started to see a new

4:59 new header that was added. This new header

5:01 might look kind of nice, but maybe we

5:03 want to revert to what we had previously.

5:05 So let's add an issue and

5:07 see if Claude can help us out.

5:08 You can imagine we have an issue here.

5:10 The application has a new header that was added,

5:14 Let's go back to the old one.

5:16 Make sure to keep the toggle theme but just

5:19 make the header look like what it was before. We'll also specify,

5:23 make sure to remove the Course Materials Assistant header.

5:27 Remove the subheader.

5:28 around ask questions, and then remove the

5:32 horizontal row below the subheader.

5:39 Now that we created this issue,

5:41 we could assign someone to tackle it.

5:42 But why don't we just ask Claude to help us out?

5:44 Claude, can you fix this for me? Once we tag in Claude,

5:47 we're going to start to give Claude a little bit of time

5:49 to fix the issue at hand.

5:51 When Claude has fixed that issue,

5:53 it should be able to generate a pull request

5:55 to fix that particular one. So

5:57 let's give Claude a little bit of

5:58 time to find that action. Here we're

6:00 going to see Claude Code is working,

6:02 and if we want to see the underlying job that's run,

6:04 we can go ahead and do that. So

6:06 let's give Claude a little bit of time

6:07 and see what it can come up with.

6:09 What you're seeing is going to look very familiar

6:11 to what we saw in the command line.

6:13 Analyze the structure, remove the header.

6:16 And here, I can even choose what to prioritize if I'd like.

6:20 But what you're seeing here is the same

6:22 thing we saw just outside of the

6:24 terminal. Not only can we use Claude

6:25 to tackle issues and pull requests,

6:28 we can also use Claude to review code as we saw before.

6:30 As we start to see its plan, we'll notice

6:33 what the changes are that are being

6:35 made, where in the codebase it's proposing things,

6:38 and as we see the pull request, we can start to

6:40 see some of the thinking and logic behind what's being done.

6:43 Seems like this one isn't too tough,

6:44 so it's going to follow these steps,

6:46 test the changes, commit and push those.

6:48 It's now made the commit necessary.

6:50 We can see the underlying description here.

6:53 If we'd like, we can create this pull request,

6:55 or we can just have Claude do all that work for us.

6:58 When we create the pull request.

6:59 We see exactly what was generated in the commit.

7:02 And now, let's go take a look and see what Claude did.

7:05 We can take a look at the underlying files that we changed.

7:08 There wasn't too much here. We can merge this in.

7:10 As we saw before, Claude's also going to take

7:12 some time and review the code that Claude wrote.

7:15 And this can actually be quite helpful because

7:16 as much as we want to trust Claude,

7:18 it's nice to have another Claude double checking its work.

7:21 So it looks like Claude Code

7:22 has approved the task I have here.

7:23 Let's merge this in. And then we'll head back to the terminal

7:26 and make sure to pull down the changes. is that we have.

7:29 So I'll head over to VS Code, pull down the changes.

7:34 And let's see if our front end looks any better.

7:37 And there we have it. The header

7:39 is taken out, the horizontal rows taken out.

7:40 We might want to bring back that

7:42 horizontal row or move this to another place.

7:44 But now we know how to do it,

7:46 not only in the terminal, but also in GitHub.

7:49 One more piece of functionality that I want

7:51 to show is something that was recently released,

7:53 which is the ability to add

7:55 what's called a hook to Claude Code.

7:57 If you're familiar here with this idea of

7:59 hooks. This is going to feel very similar.

8:01 The idea is that as we have different operations in Claude Code,

8:05 like executing a tool or something happening after a tool,

8:09 we can inject specific code to run at any

8:12 point in the life cycle of Claude Code's operation.

8:16 Let me show you what I mean

8:17 by that. Back in VS code, I'm going

8:18 to hop in back to Claude again. And

8:21 while we can make these changes manually, I

8:23 want to show you the editor that we have.

8:25 So I'm going to type in slash hooks.

8:28 manage configurations for tool events.

8:30 What you're seeing might look a little bit scary,

8:33 but it's our obligation to let you know.

8:35 If you are running arbitrary shell commands,

8:38 you have to be very careful about what you're doing.

8:40 There are quite a few different events that we can run hooks.

8:43 Before a tool is executed, we can

8:45 even stop that tool from being executed.

8:48 We can do something after, when a notification is sent,

8:51 when the user submits a prompt, when something stops,

8:53 or even before a subagent concludes its

8:56 response. So we have the ability to

8:58 programmatically to tap in to any of these events.

9:02 I want to show a simple example with a PostToolUse hook.

9:06 Start by adding a matcher. In this matcher,

9:08 I can specify the tools that I want

9:11 to be matched for this hook to run.

9:14 I'm going to add a very, very

9:15 simple example here. Anytime there is a Read

9:18 or anytime there is a Grep,

9:21 I'm going to run a simple terminal command.

9:23 The new hook or command I'm

9:25 going to run is the say command.

9:27 The say command, runs the computer's audio

9:29 and a path for what text you'd like it to say.

9:33 So if I've done this correctly, after we have read something

9:36 or use the grep tool to find something

9:38 in a file, our machine should say, all done.

9:41 Let's add this again in our project settings.

9:43 We mentioned earlier the settings.local.json file where we can specify permissions.

9:49 This is also where your hooks live.

9:51 Inside of our .claude,

9:53 we can see in our settings.local.json,

9:56 not only do we have our permissions,

9:58 but we now have a hook that we've defined.

10:00 PostToolUse is the name of the hook,

10:02 the matcher, which if you take out will apply to anything.

10:06 But here, reading or grep,

10:09 go run the command say 'All done!' when we're done.

10:11 Let's try this out. I'm going to quit out of Claude Code.

10:14 I'm going to open it up again.

10:16 read the contents of the run.sh file.

10:19 This should use the read tool as expected. All done.

10:22 And once it's done, it notifies us and tells us all done.

10:25 Well, this is kind of a fun little example, you can

10:28 imagine executing code like running tests or running linters

10:31 or potentially stopping tools from being

10:33 used if that's not what we want

10:35 or even having Claude review itself when certain things happen.

10:38 There's a lot you can do with

10:39 hooks and there's so much more that's coming.

10:41 So make sure to look at the

10:42 documentation to see everything you can do.

10:44 And you can always use Claude Code to

10:47 write hooks for you and modify them accordingly.

10:49 In the next section, we'll explore using Claude Code with Jupyter notebooks

10:52 to create visualizations, refactor code, and operate in a slightly different environment.
