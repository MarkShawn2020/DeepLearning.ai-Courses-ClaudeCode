0:02 The first example we'll work on is an end-to-end RAG chatbot.

0:06 Let's use Claude Code to explore the code base.

0:09 Before we start using Claude Code

0:11 to write lots of code for us,

0:13 let's talk about how we can use this tool

0:16 to get up to speed on larger code bases.

0:19 Right here, I have an application where I can chat with Claude

0:23 about course materials from Deep Learning AI.

0:26 So let's try asking an outline of a course. For example, what

0:29 is the outline of the MCP Build Rich-Context AI Apps with Anthropic.

0:34 We'll see here that I'll get a

0:36 response with quite a bit of detail

0:38 around the lessons and descriptions for each of those lessons.

0:41 With that in mind, let's see how we can get

0:44 up to speed on the underlying code that powers this application.

0:48 Back in VS Code, I have

0:49 the terminal open here and I'm going

0:51 to hop into Claude Code just

0:53 by typing in claude and pressing enter.

0:55 In this application, I can start chatting with my codebase.

0:58 So I'm going to start with a high-level question just to

1:01 give me an overview of the codebase.

1:04 What we're going to see Claude Code do is agentically search

1:07 over the codebase, figure out some of the most important files

1:12 and give me a description of what's happening in this application.

1:15 Instead of searching through each individual file,

1:18 we're going to agentically search and find the most relevant ones.

1:21 So here we're going to get some information about

1:24 the architecture, the key components, some of the features,

1:28 and now if there are particular

1:30 things I want to dig into, I can easily do that.

1:33 I can also ask other higher level questions like how

1:36 are these documents processed?

1:38 In this application, we're using Retrieval Augmented Generation

1:42 to fetch information about these courses.

1:45 If I want to get more information about that process,

1:48 I can ask a question like this one.

1:50 We like to say that Claude Code is a fantastic

1:52 engineer alongside you,

1:54 but it's an even better explainer.

1:56 So as you're getting up to speed with new codebases,

1:59 new data sets. First, start using Claude Code

2:02 as a way to explain things to you,

2:04 so that when you ask it to write code,

2:06 you can have a better understanding of what's going on.

2:09 Here we can see the sources in the

2:12 code base that are actually splitting text into chunks,

2:15 that are adding lesson context and that are storing course metadata.

2:18 This ability to quickly get up to speed with a code base,

2:22 especially when you might not be

2:24 familiar with the underlying technology or language,

2:27 is exceptionally valuable. Instead of

2:29 navigating to each of these folders and figuring out what's going on,

2:34 we can ask more specific questions and even get diagrams

2:38 and visualizations made for us.

2:41 So the first thing I'll ask Claude

2:43 is to trace the process of handling a user's query

2:47 from front end to back end.

2:50 You can imagine you might have some limited knowledge

2:53 in one of the parts of the stack or

2:55 you're not familiar with how this is all happening.

2:58 So Claude Code is going to

2:59 give us quite some useful information here.

3:02 What's useful when you're seeing Claude Code work

3:04 is its ability to give you a bit of a to-do list,

3:07 so you can start to understand

3:09 what's happening. At any point in time,

3:12 you can press escape and guide Claude Code

3:15 to follow a different set of to-dos,

3:17 but in this case, I feel pretty good about what it's doing.

3:20 It's going to start tracing from the frontend, start following API endpoints,

3:24 analyze our Retrieval Augmented Generation system,

3:28 and then figure out how to actually generate the response.

3:31 It's reading the appropriate files that are handling these particular tasks

3:36 and finishing up its list to give us a powerful summary.

3:39 As we're in this environment,

3:41 we can stay within VS Code or open

3:43 up Claude Code in its own dedicated terminal instance.

3:47 That's completely up to you as you're working in this application.

3:50 Once it's done, we can see a

3:52 very detailed path for what's happening here.

3:55 Not only can I read each of these step-by-step,

3:58 I can even ask Claude to write this to a file,

4:00 but I'm seeing in quite a bit

4:02 of detail what's happening on the front end

4:04 with some JavaScript, what happens once that reaches my back end,

4:07 what the Retrieval Augmented Generation system is doing,

4:11 how I'm generating a response. Finally,

4:14 how I'm searching through my vector database,

4:16 how I'm filtering what's necessary, getting a response back,

4:20 and then finally, sending that to the user.

4:23 There's a lot that's going on in this application.

4:25 And I can use Claude to

4:26 dive deeper into any of those pieces.

4:29 But let's just say I learn best from visualizations.

4:32 So let's ask Claude to draw a diagram

4:34 that illustrates this flow.

4:37 We can ask Claude to draw diagrams

4:39 for web visualizations. We can ask for ASCII art.

4:43 But let's see what Claude comes up with

4:44 with its own intelligence and knowledge of how the application works.

4:49 So let's see what Claude code has come up with.

4:51 We've got a really nice diagram here

4:53 showing us the step-by-step process.

4:55 So it can't create these visual diagrams.

4:58 We could always ask it to use some something like D3.js

5:01 or recharts if we want something like a web application.

5:05 But we can see right here, we've got a really nice diagram.

5:08 From the front end, making a request to the back end,

5:11 calling the necessary functions,

5:13 generating the response necessary if there's any history involved,

5:18 talking directly to the large language model

5:21 with our system prompts and our tools and a query,

5:23 figuring out where to go next,

5:25 searching through our vector database using Chroma DB, getting back results

5:29 formatting that, sending it to the model to produce a final response.

5:34 There's quite a bit of detail that goes into this.

5:37 And if we want, we can even augment Claude with additional tools

5:41 for generating the visualizations that we want.

5:44 But out of the box, just getting this information quickly and efficiently

5:48 is going to help us get up to speed with this

5:50 codebase in a fraction of time that we used to spend.

5:54 So with that in mind, let's ask a

5:56 very simple question, how do I run

5:58 this application? You might be in a situation

6:00 where there's a new technology here, a new idea.

6:03 Very simply, it's nice to just

6:05 know how to get up and running.

6:07 I can see here, my API documentation,

6:09 my web interface, and if there are any environment variables I need,

6:13 I'm good to go. Now that you've gotten an idea

6:16 of how to just start talking to Claude Code.

6:18 Let's talk a little bit about some of the more powerful features

6:20 with Claude Code.

6:22 When you start working with an application in Claude Code,

6:25 one of the first things we

6:26 recommend you do is run a command

6:28 called /init.

6:29 You can see here in Claude Code, when I add this slash,

6:33 we have a list of many built-in commands that I can use.

6:36 /init allows me to initialize

6:38 a CLAUDE.md file with the codebase documentation.

6:42 The CLAUDE.md file is mission critical

6:45 for introducing memory for Claude Code,

6:48 so that it knows how best to work in your codebase.

6:52 The CLAUDE.md file is very useful

6:54 for specifying how you want things to be run.

6:57 This could be your tests, this could be your linting,

6:59 and any long-term memory that you want Claude to have

7:03 each time you're working with Claude Code for this particular project.

7:07 Instead of making this from scratch, /init

7:09 is going to analyze the codebase

7:11 to figure out at a high level what it should know about

7:14 each time you're working with this application.

7:18 There are three different CLAUDE.md files that you can make,

7:21 like the one generated with /init

7:23 all the way here on the left.

7:26 This CLAUDE.md file lives in your application. You can

7:29 have many of them in nested sub folders.

7:32 But this is shared with other

7:34 engineers and committed to your version control.

7:37 Another option is if you have personal instructions

7:39 and customizations, think specific for your editing environment

7:42 and terminal environment, you can put that in a CLAUDE.local.md file.

7:49 This is git ignored and not shared with other engineers.

7:53 Finally, in your home directory, in the

7:55 .claude folder, you can add a CLAUDE.md

7:57 and you can think of this like a

7:59 global claude.md for all projects on your machine.

8:03 This is helpful if you want Claude to follow instructions across

8:07 a wide range of projects that you build with Claude Code.

8:17 We can go ahead and allow Claude Code to find different

8:20 files so that it knows how best to create this CLAUDE.md file.

8:24 This CLAUDE.md file is meant to be

8:26 added to your current git project and

8:29 shared with other team members.

8:31 As more individuals work on the codebase,

8:34 they can add to this CLAUDE.md file,

8:36 and you can even nest CLAUDE.md files

8:39 in subdirectories if you need

8:41 more specific instructions for things like the backend

8:44 or frontend or our docs that we have here.

8:46 What's really nice about using a tool

8:49 like Claude Code with Visual Studio Code,

8:51 is that as I see changes to files,

8:54 I can see those visually in my editor.

8:56 And anytime that I am using a tool in Claude Code,

9:00 it's going to ask me for permissions.

9:02 This mission critical human in the loop is really important

9:05 when you get up and running,

9:07 and if you don't need Claude to ask you every single time,

9:10 can always use this second option. We'll

9:12 go ahead and auto accept those edits

9:14 and we'll see that a CLAUDE.md file has been created for us.

9:18 To give you a quick walk through,

9:21 we can see it's given us a

9:23 project overview, key technologies, an architectural overview,

9:26 a nice little diagram here, some core components.

9:29 and much more. If we want things to change

9:32 to this particular CLAUDE.md, we can easily do so.

9:35 As it continues searching the codebase,

9:37 it makes additional edits here to my CLAUDE.md

9:40 and gives me a summary of what's been done.

9:43 When I'm using a tool like Claude Code in VS Code,

9:46 I have the ability to specify which

9:48 file I'm in and even get information

9:49 about particular lines.

9:52 To set this up, I'm going to use the /ide command.

9:55 and I can see right here

9:57 that I'm connected with Visual Studio Code.

9:58 Now that I'm in Visual Studio Code, we can see right here

10:01 that the second that I visit a file,

10:04 it's tagged right here for what's going on.

10:06 This gives Claude Code the right context

10:08 for which file I'm in and if there are questions

10:11 I have about that file, it makes it easier

10:13 for Claude Code to identify that.

10:15 If I ever want to make any changes

10:17 to my CLAUDE.md file, I can manually write that if I'd like.

10:20 Or I can use a handy command

10:22 to go ahead and use this pound key

10:24 and directly add to memory.

10:26 So I'm just going to say here, always use UV.

10:29 to run the server, do not use pip directly.

10:32 This is a package manager in the Python ecosystem

10:35 and I want to make sure that Claude doesn't get confused.

10:37 When I use this shortcut, we can see there are different places

10:41 where this memory can be saved.

10:42 We mentioned there is the Project memory

10:45 that is included in git for everyone on your team to use.

10:48 We have local memory that is gitignored

10:51 but just useful for you as the developer.

10:53 and then User memory that is applicable

10:56 to all projects you use with Claude Code.

10:59 For this one, I'll just go ahead and update the project memory.

11:02 I can see here, I've made that change.

11:04 And if I look in my CLAUDE.md, I'll see right here,

11:07 I have some mentions to using UV

11:10 to make sure that I'm doing that correctly.

11:12 If I want to be more specific, I can also say,

11:15 make sure to use UV to manage all dependencies.

11:19 I'll add this to my CLAUDE.md and

11:21 we'll see right here that it's been added.

11:23 If I take a quick look at this particular file,

11:26 we can see any mention of dependencies now includes UV.

11:39 We spoke a little bit about some of the commands

11:41 that are built into Claude Code like /emit.

11:45 There are a couple other useful

11:46 ones that I want to showcase here.

11:48 And in fact, we're going to see later on

11:50 in this course, we can even make our own.

11:52 One of the first ones I

11:53 want to walk you through is /help.

11:54 This shows me right off the bat a quick description

11:58 of all the commands. and a quick summary.

12:00 This is useful as you're getting up to speed with Claude code.

12:04 The next one I want to showcase is a command called /clear.

12:07 What this allows you to do is

12:10 clear the conversation history and start from scratch.

12:13 This is very helpful as you shift gears and build new features.

12:17 This allows you to clear the context window and start fresh.

12:20 If you want to continue the conversation,

12:23 have a smaller context window, but still

12:25 have a summary of what's been done,

12:28 we also have this command /compact

12:30 that allows you to clear the history, but keep a summary

12:33 so that you can build off with Claude having an idea

12:36 of what was done before.

12:38 One more useful command is the escape key that allows you

12:41 to get out of whatever command you're in.

12:43 So if I'm going and trying to do something like /compact

12:47 and I want to stop that process, I can always press escape.

12:50 If I start a process with Claude Code

12:52 to explain what is in the codebase.

12:55 If I want to stop that process, escape

12:57 will allow me to interrupt and continue, onwards.

13:00 So don't feel like you have to wait for

13:02 Claude Code if you're not getting what you need.

13:04 In the next lesson, we'll start using Claude Code to build features,

13:08 add to files, modify changes, and make sure

13:11 we're doing the right thing along the way.

13:14 Before we hop off, one last useful piece with

13:16 Claude Code is its ability to work with Git.

13:18 So I've made some small changes to this application,

13:21 and I want to add and commit these changes.

13:24 Instead of me manually have to write

13:26 the Git commands, write a descriptive commit message,

13:29 going to actually have Claude Code do that work for us.

13:32 And what's really nice is Claude Code's ability to add

13:35 and commit the necessary commands.

13:37 I'll go ahead and add this particular file,

13:39 not only commit, but you can see here,

13:42 I've got this really nice descriptive commit message.

13:44 That's incredibly useful as we start asking Claude Code

13:47 about historical changes with git.

13:49 and when we push this to GitHub and

13:51 other people are reading the changes

13:53 we made. So we'll add and commit

13:54 and the next lesson, we'll use Claude Code

13:57 to start writing lots of things for us.
