Transcript

0:02 You can open multiple sessions with Claude

0:04 Code to work on many features in parallel.

0:08 To manage these sessions and make sure you're not

0:11 overwriting the same file, you can use Git worktrees.

0:14 So let's add Git worktrees to add

0:16 three features to the chatbot in parallel.

0:19 I'll see you there. So I'm going to hop back into Claude.

0:21 And as we saw earlier, Claude Code comes built in

0:24 with quite a few slash commands.

0:27 But you can also make your

0:28 own. To make your own custom commands,

0:29 inside of the dot claude folder.

0:32 Let's make a new folder called commands.

0:34 And inside of here, we're going to make a markdown file

0:38 with the name of the command that we'd like.

0:40 The command here that I'm going to make is called implement feature.

0:44 So I'll create a markdown file called implement-feature.md

0:48 Inside here, I can place whatever I'd like.

0:51 But what I want to show you that's very special

0:54 is if you have any arguments you

0:56 want to pass to your custom command, you can reference it using

1:01 this $ARGUMENTS variable.

1:03 So what I'm asking for here

1:04 is that when this command is used,

1:06 I'll be specifying that you're implementing a new feature.

1:09 The user can then specify whatever that feature is,

1:13 and then I want to make

1:14 sure that Claude Code is well aware

1:15 to only do this for front-end features,

1:18 and to write the changes made to a file called frontend-changes.md

1:22 You can imagine there are many different use cases for custom commands,

1:26 certain ways you want to run tests or run files.

1:29 and anything that you put in here

1:31 does not automatically get added to your context,

1:34 unlike a CLAUDE.md

1:36 So if you want something to be applied

1:39 to every single instance of Claude Code that you make,

1:42 use your CLAUDE.md file.

1:44 But if you just have specific commands

1:46 that you may or may not use across different conversations,

1:50 right here is a great place to put them.

1:52 I'm going to be using this custom command

1:54 when I start talking about worktrees.

1:56 But before we do that, let's quit out of Claude Code,

1:59 hop back in and just verify

2:01 that we can see that custom command.

2:04 And here, I see implement feature, and I see the description

2:07 is coming from the first part of this markdown file.

2:10 Now that I've added this custom command,

2:13 let's go ahead and add and commit it.

2:15 I could do this from the command line,

2:17 but I'm actually going to ask Claude to do that for me.

2:20 Add and commit changes made.

2:22 This is nice so that Claude Code can create

2:24 a nice commit message

2:26 with some descriptive information for what was done.

2:29 We'll see that it's adding the .claude folder

2:31 and committing with the commands necessary.

2:34 We can see here that this has been added to the repository.

2:37 And since we've granted permissions for this already,

2:40 we don't have to respond again.

2:42 If you're ever curious where that lives,

2:44 inside of the claude folder,

2:46 there is a settings.local.json file

2:49 Inside of this file, we can specify

2:52 what commands we've allowed so that we don't need

2:54 to confirm every single time.

2:57 As you can see here, as well,

2:58 when we use playwright, we gave permissions.

3:00 And if you'd like to add your own,

3:02 you can easily do so in this file,

3:04 or even with the handy /permissions command.

3:08 Now that we've got that custom command set up,

3:10 let's talk a little bit about how we

3:12 might want to work in parallel with Claude Code.

3:14 Instead of just opening up multiple terminal

3:17 windows and working directly on this code base,

3:20 we're going to use Git to make sure

3:23 that we don't overwrite existing files when we have

3:27 multiple instances of Claude Code.

3:29 I might have two different instances of

3:31 Claude Code operating on the same file.

3:34 And if I do that with

3:35 the environment that I'm in right now,

3:37 there's going to be overwriting, bug

3:39 creation and quite a bit of confusion.

3:42 Thankfully, Git has an excellent option here

3:44 to use a feature called worktrees.

3:46 And worktrees allow me to essentially create copies of the codebase,

3:51 operate in isolation,

3:53 and then at the end, merge those in together. And in fact,

3:57 I can use Claude to help with that merging

4:00 and management of my worktrees.

4:02 To get started with worktrees,

4:03 I'm going to first make a folder called .trees

4:06 And inside of this worktrees folder,

4:09 I'm going to go ahead and add a couple worktrees.

4:12 Let's add a work tree using the Git worktree add command.

4:15 and then we'll specify the folder as well

4:19 as the name of the work tree that I want to add.

4:21 We'll call this one ui\_feature. We'll

4:23 then go ahead and add another one

4:26 called testing\_feature,

4:27 and then finally a third one called quality\_feature.

4:31 To confirm I've created all of these, I can take a look

4:35 and I can see that I'm on the main branch currently

4:37 and that I've created three separate worktrees.

4:40 To set up correctly in each of these environments,

4:43 I'm going to open up the trees folder,

4:46 and I'm going to open up

4:47 a terminal for each one of them.

4:49 I'll start with my ui\_feature and bring that over here.

4:53 I'll then go ahead, bring in my testing feature,

4:55 and I'll move that right to the side.

4:57 Finally, let's bring in our quality\_feature.

4:59 Go ahead, bring that over up here.

5:02 To give us a little more

5:04 room, we'll make this a bit smaller.

5:05 And now we have three dedicated terminal windows.

5:08 And we'll hide the explorer as well.

5:10 Now, let's open up Claude for each one of these environments.

5:14 What we can do now is run Claude Code in parallel and

5:18 make sure that if the same files are modified, we're not overwriting

5:23 and we can fix that later

5:24 when we merge in these worktrees.

5:26 I'm going to use this implement-feature command.

5:29 And then I'm going to put in

5:31 a particular feature that I'd like here.

5:33 And that feature allows me to add a

5:36 toggle button to switch between dark and light themes.

5:38 So let's go ahead and create a toggle button, position it,

5:42 and make sure that I can navigate for this particular toggle button.

5:46 We'll start with this part and

5:47 then add in the light theme variant.

5:49 While this is running, I can now move to another work tree.

5:53 And in this second work tree, let's start thinking

5:55 a little bit about what I

5:57 want to do for this testing framework.

5:58 going to pass in a prompt here to enhance

6:01 the existing testing framework and add additional tests for FastAPI endpoints.

6:06 While that's going, let's add some essential

6:08 code quality tools to our development workflow.

6:11 As we do this, we can start

6:13 to see that changes are being requested.

6:15 So let's go ahead and shift between these

6:17 environments and confirm the changes that

6:19 we want. Our tests are being written

6:21 and our additional development dependencies for analyzing

6:25 code base structure and formatting are being added as well.

6:28 What we're going to see here

6:30 is that we're modifying a file called pyproject.toml

6:33 And we're also going to see that there's a request being added

6:37 to edit that particular file as well.

6:40 As we continue these options

6:42 will make edits to these files,

6:44 and we'll go ahead and see at the same time

6:46 that our front end code is being done as expected.

6:48 We can work in parallel and make sure

6:51 that none of these particular changes are being overwritten by

6:55 other parts of the codebase. If there happen

6:57 to be changes that we've made to similar files,

6:59 we can ensure that those merge conflicts are fixed.

7:02 and we can do that using Claude.

7:04 Our front-end changes are being written,

7:06 we're adding more tests, and we're adding some

7:08 formatting tools and development scripts for quality checks.

7:12 So we're going to proceed as expected,

7:13 making sure that quality scripts are being done,

7:16 and it looks like our front-end features are being added.

7:19 Now, add that light theme,

7:21 the same way that we did previously. We'll use our implement feature,

7:24 custom command to make sure we're writing that to our change log.

7:28 and we'll add a light theme as

7:29 well. Once that's done, we'll go ahead and

7:31 cue up a few other prompts we'd like

7:34 for JavaScript functionality and implementation details.

7:36 So while that's running, I can check in on other scripts.

7:39 I can confirm I want to run those,

7:41 and if there's something going on, Claude Code can fix per necessary.

7:45 Seems like there are some scripts that Claude doesn't know about,

7:48 so we'll go ahead and either install dependencies

7:50 or make sure we're running things as expected.

7:53 You can see here, we're starting from code quality checks.

7:55 We've written our API endpoint testing and we're adding more

7:59 front end functionality. Once this is all

8:01 done, we can head over to the browser.

8:03 We can confirm our checks are done,

8:04 but before we go ahead and do that,

8:07 let's bring in all of these individual changes.

8:09 If we wanted to run the tests,

8:11 we can confirm this is as expected.

8:13 We want to head to the browser

8:14 for our UI testing, we can do so.

8:16 And here we can see Codebase formatting is done, Development scripts have

8:19 been added, and documentation has been

8:21 updated. We saw before there was a

8:24 the pyproject.toml file that was added across two different worktrees.

8:27 So there might be some conflicts when figuring out these individual pieces.

8:31 Now that we feel good about each

8:33 of these changes, let's add and commit with a descriptive message.

8:37 Let's also do the same thing on this work tree.

8:39 Since we're going to be merging in these particular commits,

8:42 we're going to want to make sure we have descriptive commit messages

8:44 we can understand what was done in each of these worktrees.

8:47 We've committed this particular commit,

8:50 we're doing the same on this one right here.

8:52 We finished up our UI enhancement. So let's do the same.

8:55 add and commit with a descriptive message.

8:58 If you find yourself writing these kinds of

9:00 prompts like add and commit with a descriptive message,

9:02 this also could be another use case for

9:04 a nice custom command where we can specify

9:07 exactly some styling that we want or the

9:09 way that our company operates with best Git practices.

9:11 Now that I finished committing across all three of these,

9:14 I can now go back to my

9:16 main branch and merge some things in.

9:18 So I'm going to close these terminal

9:19 environments and hop back to our main one.

9:22 So now I'm going to ask Claude...

9:23 To use the Git merge command

9:26 to merge in all of the worktrees in the .trees folder

9:30 and fix any conflicts if there are any.

9:33 So let's have Claude Code merge all of these particular trees

9:37 and make sure that they work as expected.

9:39 We can see here there are three worktrees available.

9:41 So we're going to start by merging in each of these worktrees.

9:44 We'll confirm this is the command we want to use,

9:47 and then this should work as expected.

9:49 Looks like our testing feature doesn't have any conflicts.

9:52 Let's bring on our UI feature.

9:54 And again, we could write these commands on our own,

9:56 but Claude Code knows exactly what to do from our prompt.

9:59 Now we can merge in the quality feature branch.

10:01 And here we'll see if there are any conflicts.

10:04 and as we can see, in this particular file, there are conflicts.

10:08 So what we're going to have Claude Code do

10:10 is analyze these conflicts and complete the merge.

10:12 This can be quite valuable when you have small merge conflicts

10:15 that you don't want to manually go through each time.

10:18 Having tests here is also quite valuable

10:20 to make sure that once we've finished, we could

10:22 run our tests and the code base works as expected.

10:25 It's now continuing with the merge as expected.

10:27 and it's going to commit all of

10:29 these changes with the resolved merge conflicts.

10:31 If I'd like after, I can ask for it to remove

10:34 these worktrees or I can keep them there if I need.

10:36 So I'll do a quick test to

10:38 make sure that these files are here

10:40 as expected and that the merge configurations

10:41 are what are expected here as well.

10:43 We can also head back to the browser and

10:46 see if our front end changes are implemented as expected.

10:48 Looks like Claude Code has finished up, we've added necessary dependencies,

10:52 we've modified our pyproject.toml

10:54 We've added tests.

10:56 we've implemented the light dark themes.

10:58 We've implemented our black code formatter

11:01 to make sure that code is as expected in a certain format.

11:04 and added that configuration in the same file

11:06 that we worked on with another work tree.

11:09 We fixed up any conflicts.

11:11 Let's make sure this is working

11:12 as expected. So back in the browser,

11:14 I now see here, I have this lovely theme

11:17 and as I toggle through, I can

11:19 see a light theme and a dark theme.

11:21 So there might be some more things

11:22 I want to tweak here and there,

11:24 but I've been able to edit across all parts of the stack,

11:27 even do things in the linting and DevOps side of things,

11:32 all without overwriting,

11:34 causing challenging headaches through the power of Git worktrees.

11:37 In the next lesson, we're going to see how

11:40 we can use Claude Code outside of the terminal

11:42 through an integration with GitHub to allow for reviewing pull requests,

11:47 making changes and being helpful outside of the terminal ecosystem.
