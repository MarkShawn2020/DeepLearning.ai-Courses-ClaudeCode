0:02 Now that you have an understanding

0:03 of the chatbot codebase, let's add features to the UI

0:06 and implement a new tool for the chatbot.

0:09 Now that we've gotten up to speed on this codebase,

0:12 let's talk a little bit about

0:14 some features we might want to add.

0:16 We saw before, in this application,

0:18 when we ask for an outline of a course,

0:21 we get some really detailed information

0:23 and we even see some of the sources that are referenced.

0:27 At the same time, when we see

0:29 these sources that are referenced, it would be really nice

0:32 to be able to click on these as links and go to

0:35 the source of truth.

0:37 So we want to build an interface

0:39 where the front end and back end

0:41 are correctly rendering links to show where

0:44 this data is coming from

0:46 and not just some text.

0:48 So let's hop over to Claude and talk

0:50 a little bit about how to get started.

0:52 What we're going to do here instead of

0:54 just asking Claude to implement the feature necessary,

0:57 we're going to make use of two important pieces.

1:00 The first one is referencing the correct file,

1:03 and the second is using plan mode.

1:06 When we talk about referencing the correct file,

1:08 Claude Code is only as good

1:10 as the context that you give it.

1:12 So when you ask Claude Code to make changes,

1:15 it's important to make sure that we're figuring

1:18 out the right files we need to modify.

1:20 We can have Claude Code try to figure this out,

1:23 but if we know out of the box

1:25 what files need to be modified, giving

1:28 in Claude Code this context right

1:30 away makes the tool much more

1:31 efficient. So let's see how that's done.

1:34 I'm going to open up Claude Code and to reference a file,

1:37 I simply use this at and tag that file.

1:41 For a folder, I can reference files inside.

1:44 For a file directly, I can go ahead

1:47 and even use tab to complete for the full file name.

1:50 With that in mind,

1:52 let's talk next about the second

1:54 important piece when building features or making

1:57 larger changes. Instead of having Claude trying to figure out what

2:01 needs to be done and write the code right away.

2:04 We're going to follow a slightly

2:06 different pattern. We're going to plan first.

2:08 We're going to have Claude create a detailed

2:11 plan for what changes need to be done.

2:14 And if we approve that plan,

2:16 we're then going to have Claude Code

2:17 make changes to quite a few files.

2:19 When you have slightly larger changes to make,

2:22 we always recommend starting with plan mode

2:25 so you can give Claude the opportunity

2:27 to figure out what needs to be done

2:29 before it needs to make those changes. To activate plan mode,

2:33 I'm going to press shift tab twice.

2:35 And we'll see here that plan mode is on.

2:38 Let's showcase what needs to be done. I'm going

2:39 to bring in a prompt that I have here,

2:41 and I'm going to ask it

2:43 to build an interface with source citations.

2:46 You can notice here that I'm referencing the correct files

2:49 as well as referencing other files where changes need to be made.

2:53 So let's give Claude the opportunity to come up

2:56 up with a plan for how to solve this particular problem.

2:59 As always, it's going to read through

3:01 the files that it thinks are most necessary.

3:03 It's going to trace its way from the front end

3:06 to the back end and understand what needs to be implemented.

3:09 Once we finish getting a plan, we're going to have the opportunity

3:12 to either approve it or to give Claude

3:14 some feedback for what might need to be changed.

3:17 But here, Claude is not directly writing any code.

3:21 As we see here, we can accept and

3:23 then continue to auto-accept edits so we can

3:25 don't have to keep asking for permission.

3:27 We can manually approve them or we

3:29 can tell Claude to change the

3:30 plan. Taking a quick look at this,

3:32 I feel pretty good about what we need to do.

3:34 So let's use that plan with our auto-accept edits.

3:37 If you ever want to turn this on on its own,

3:40 you can press shift tab just one time.

3:42 We'll see the to-do list necessary.

3:45 We'll see what changes need to be made.

3:47 And now we're going to let Claude Code

3:49 write to the files that it seems necessary,

3:51 and then we can test that the implementation works correctly.

3:54 correctly. We'll see here, files are being modified,

3:57 changes are being made to the codebase.

4:00 And since we added the auto

4:01 accept, we don't have to keep giving

4:03 permission over and over.

4:05 Very common workflow that we see is users start by asking

4:10 for permission each time.

4:11 And as more trust is given by the human to Claude Code,

4:15 the auto-accept edits come on a bit more.

4:17 We can see here finally, that we

4:19 can start the application to test the implementation.

4:22 But in fact, the server is running already.

4:25 So I'm just going to tell Claude, no, thank you.

4:27 I'll say right off the that, the server is running.

4:30 No need to start it yourself.

4:32 If I want Claude Code to always do that,

4:35 this is a great opportunity to just

4:37 put something into the CLAUDE.md file as well.

4:40 Now that I've let Claude Code know that, it's

4:42 going to tell me the changes that have been made.

4:44 So let's test this. Now let's try asking the same question.

4:48 Let's ask for an outline of a course.

4:51 And if this has been built

4:52 correctly, you should be able to see

4:54 links below for each one of these particular features.

4:58 If I take a look, right here I have links

5:01 that will take me to the right place,

5:03 but the interface is a little bit difficult to see

5:06 because of this blue link color.

5:09 If I'd like, I can go ahead and ask

5:11 Claude Code to make the change necessary to do so.

5:14 So let's go and follow up with Claude

5:16 and ask it to make this interface a little bit more pleasant.

5:19 One option that I have here is just to tell Claude.

5:23 here is what I want. Another option is to use Claude's visual

5:26 ability to take a look at a screenshot

5:29 and analyze what needs to be changed.

5:32 So let's take a screenshot of what this interface looks like.

5:35 and we're going to go ahead and paste that into Claude Code.

5:39 Back in Claude Code, when I

5:41 paste that screenshot, I'm going to say,

5:44 these links are hard to read.

5:45 Can you make this more visually appealing?

5:49 We're going to go ahead and give Claude the ability to analyze

5:52 that image and figure out where things need

5:54 to be changed on the front end.

5:56 And we can see here I can see the issue.

5:58 The links are using a default blue color.

6:01 Let me go ahead and make a change.

6:03 When you need Claude Code to make visual changes,

6:06 taking screenshots and showing Claude Code the screenshot

6:09 is a very powerful way of quickly iterating against what we need.

6:13 Let's go back to the browser

6:14 and see what things look like now.

6:16 We'll ask again for an outline of a course.

6:19 And if this is done what we've

6:21 expected, we should see that these links

6:22 are a bit nicer to take a look at.

6:25 Let's take a look at our

6:27 sources and look at that. Much better.

6:29 The ability for Claude Code to see screenshots and make changes

6:33 is one of the most commonly used features we see

6:36 and incredibly valuable to build things quickly.

6:38 If I want to see those changes to files,

6:40 I can open those up in VS code

6:43 and Claude Code here will notice I'm in that particular script

6:46 and I can ask questions and get information necessary for those files.

6:50 files. This is looking good. Let's add a new feature.

6:54 Instead of building off in the context window what I have now,

6:59 I'm going to start completely from scratch and clear the conversation history.

7:04 This is going to allow me to

7:06 have a longer context window to work with

7:09 and not have Claude get potentially

7:11 confused with things that it's seen before

7:13 that are not relevant to what I'm building now.

7:16 As we saw before, when we want to build newer features,

7:19 we're going to use plan mode.

7:21 In this particular application, I want to add the ability

7:25 to start a new chat in my interface.

7:28 So instead of having to refresh the page each time,

7:31 I'd love for a button here to allow me

7:34 to reset the conversation and start a new chat again.

7:38 So let's build that. I'm going to activate plan mode.

7:40 and I'm going to go ahead and

7:41 bring in the prompt that I have here.

7:43 I'll ask Claude Code to add a new chat button

7:46 and when clicked, it should clear the conversation in the chat window.

7:49 start a new session and handle the necessary clean up.

7:53 If you ever need to make

7:54 a new line and add more context,

7:57 you can use backslash and press enter.

7:59 So if there is more I want

8:00 to add here, I can easily do so

8:02 that's a bit more visually appealing.

8:05 So let's have Claude Code figure

8:06 out what needs to be built here.

8:08 As we saw before, if there are

8:09 changes to the front end that we need,

8:11 it will find the necessary folders,

8:13 changes to the back end, the same kind of thing.

8:16 And here, it's going to come up with a comprehensive plan.

8:18 This idea of being able to plan and think before taking actions

8:23 is incredibly valuable to build the interfaces that you want.

8:27 I can take a quick look through this plan. I

8:29 can see what it's trying to do and I feel good,

8:32 so let's build it. If at any point

8:33 in time, I don't like what's being done,

8:36 I can always press escape and

8:38 navigate Claude Code in a different direction.

8:40 As always, we'll see our to-do list that needs to be built.

8:43 We'll see these files being updated

8:45 since I have auto accept edits on and

8:48 once that's done, we'll move on to the next step.

8:50 We'll start seeing some JavaScript being added

8:53 for when clicks occur, starting new conversations.

8:56 We'll see clearing inputs and focusing,

8:58 and now building a little bit of styling to match existing sections.

9:03 We can see here, it's going to test the new functionality.

9:06 And if I need to tell Claude to not run

9:08 the server, I can gladly do so if I want.

9:11 So here, instead of running the server,

9:12 I'll just tell Claude, don't do it.

9:14 And since I'm going to find myself

9:16 doing that a lot, now is a good

9:17 at the time to say,

9:18 don't run the server using

9:20 ./run.sh

9:22 I will start it myself.

9:24 I'm going to put this actually in the project memory.

9:27 If I want all other developers to do the same.

9:30 But maybe other developers might want to run the server themselves.

9:34 So I'll put that in the

9:36 project memory that's local and git ignored.

9:39 So this might be a situation where

9:41 I like to run the server myself,

9:43 but maybe other developers don't. Great use case for that Claude

9:46 local MD file. Now let's go back

9:48 to the browser and see what we built.

9:50 I'll refresh the page. And we've got this new chat button here.

9:53 Let's see if it works. We'll ask

9:55 again for an outline of the course.

9:57 We can make sure that our source links look great.

9:59 And if this does what's expected,

10:02 we can click on this button and start a new conversation.

10:04 That's looking good. Let's start a new chat.

10:07 So, even though this is working,

10:09 it still doesn't look exactly the way that I want.

10:12 And I can take screenshots and go back and forth with Claude.

10:16 or I can enhance

10:18 the tools that Claude Code has

10:21 out of the box using MCP servers.

10:25 MCP or the Model Context Protocol,

10:28 allows for tools like Claude Code

10:31 to gain additional functionality

10:33 to external data sources and systems.

10:36 What I'm going to do here

10:38 is add an MCP server for Playwright,

10:41 a popular tool for opening up a browser,

10:44 taking screenshots, and analyzing those screenshots. So instead of me manually

10:49 having to take the screenshot and have a conversation with Claude,

10:53 we're going to let Claude do it all by itself.

10:56 The first thing I'm going to

10:57 do is quit out of Claude Code

10:59 and add the necessary MCP server.

11:02 And the command to do so is claude

11:04 mcp add, the name of our MCP server, which is playwright,

11:09 and then the underlying command to start that MCP server.

11:13 That is done using npx @playwright/mcp@latest.

11:19 For any MCP server that you want to include,

11:22 you can reference the documentation.

11:24 All MCP servers will specify the necessary

11:27 command to connect to that particular server.

11:31 Let's open up Claude again and we'll

11:33 see what our MCP server looks like.

11:35 We can use the /mcp command

11:37 and here we can see that we have connected successfully

11:41 to the Playwright MCP server and we can see the tools

11:44 available that the Playwright server is giving us.

11:47 Things like evaluating JavaScript, uploading files,

11:51 pressing a key, navigating, going back.

11:54 All of these things that we might manually test,

11:56 Playwright can do that programmatically for us.

12:00 I'll press escape to go back a few times,

12:02 and let's ask Claude Code to navigate

12:05 to figure out how to build the necessary

12:07 content. So let's go and ask Claude Code

12:10 using the Playwright MCP server

12:12 visit the page that we're at

12:15 and view the new chat button.

12:18 I want that button to look the same as the other

12:22 links below for Courses and Try Asking.

12:27 Make sure this is left aligned

12:30 and that the border is removed.

12:33 Before it starts taking this action,

12:35 it's going to ask me for approval for these particular tools.

12:39 We'll see that it will visit

12:40 that page, take a screenshot and do do what's necessary.

12:44 Let's follow that and not ask for

12:46 permission each time to use this particular tool.

12:49 We can see here that the browser has opened a

12:52 new tab programmatically to our page to take a screenshot.

12:56 We'll ask Claude Code to take that screenshot

12:58 and analyze what it sees.

13:01 Here it can see the exact issue that's happening and instead of

13:05 us manually having to take the

13:07 screenshots necessary, it can programmatically fix itself.

13:09 We could have a more specific prompt as well, that keeps asking

13:13 Claude Code to make those changes necessary.

13:15 Since I don't have auto accept on, I can see the change

13:18 that's being made in VS Code.

13:20 And right out of the box, I don't

13:22 see a border and background with this

13:23 new change. That looks good to me.

13:25 Let's make those changes and continue making other changes.

13:28 I can see left align looking good.

13:31 and any other changes that need to be made here.

13:34 It's going to take another screenshot to

13:36 verify that the changes it's made look correct.

13:38 that it has the right icon prefixes used.

13:41 match other sections. With that in

13:43 mind, let's go see how he did.

13:45 I'm going to refresh the page. and it's looking good.

13:48 It's got an extra plus here. So why don't we go ahead

13:50 and ask it to take that

13:52 out. But it's left aligned and it's

13:53 using the icon that we like before.

13:56 So let's go ahead and fix this up and say,

13:59 there are now two plus icons, remove the

14:01 one closer to the text "+ New Chat"

14:04 We can see here there's already a plus in the HTML content,

14:07 so we'll remove that and let's see

14:09 what's done here. So instead of adding

14:11 that extra plus, we can see here what's being done.

14:13 If we need another snapshot, we

14:15 can visit and take a snapshot necessary.

14:18 As we can see here, Claude Code

14:20 saw there was not an open tab, so it fixed itself,

14:23 opened it up again and took the necessary screenshot.

14:27 Let's see what that looks like now. Much better.

14:30 As you can imagine, building complex interfaces

14:33 using tools like MCP playwright

14:36 makes building, designing and testing a breeze. We've made some really

14:40 nice front end changes. Let's now go and visit the back end.

14:43 Like we did before, we're going to start

14:46 fresh and instead of building off of this

14:48 conversation, we're going to start with a new one.

14:50 So let's clear the conversation history and start again.

14:54 This time, we want to build some features on the back end.

14:58 So let's put in a prompt, talk

14:59 about what's going to be done here.

15:01 I need to add another tool

15:03 that allows me to visit a particular course

15:07 and for each of those courses, see the

15:09 lesson number and the lesson title and description about that as well.

15:14 Right now, the data that I get

15:16 when I take a look at a course

15:18 is relatively high level. Let's see what I mean.

15:21 What we're going to ask Claude Code to do

15:23 here is to make a change to our search\_tools.py file.

15:27 Let's take a look at that. And

15:28 in this file, we can see right now

15:30 that we just have one tool for searching

15:34 content and getting details about that particular course. This second tool

15:39 is going to allow us to get more descriptive information

15:43 for each of the lessons in these courses.

15:45 So let's see what Claude can do. As we've done previously,

15:49 let's make a plan and make

15:51 sure we're first okay with that plan

15:53 before we start making changes to individual files.

15:56 Claude Code can see the current

15:57 architecture, had to implement the outline tool,

16:00 and since we have that CLAUDE.md

16:02 previously, it's going to more quickly be able

16:04 to understand what needs to be done.

16:07 We can take a look at what needs to be implemented,

16:09 we can make sure that we're doing

16:11 the right things in the right files.

16:12 We can see that once we create this tool,

16:15 we update the system prompt to make

16:17 sure that we get that additional data,

16:19 and then we register that tool in our RAG system.

16:22 As always, if there's anything we want to

16:24 change or suggest, we can do that now.

16:27 But let's see what Claude Code can do for us.

16:29 If this works as expected,

16:31 we should be able to ask questions about a

16:34 course and get much more detail for those particular

16:37 lessons in the course.

16:39 We can see here that not only are we

16:42 modifying the underlying Python code, but also the system prompt

16:44 and here we're registering that new tool that we've made.

16:48 Once we finished our to-do list,

16:50 we can head back to the browser

16:52 and see what things look like

16:54 and if this has been implemented correctly.

16:56 We'll see a nice summary of what's been made

16:58 and we can always change things at any point in time.

17:01 Back in the browser, let's go ahead and try asking

17:04 for some information about a course.

17:06 If this works as expected.

17:08 We should be able to get more detailed information

17:11 including a link for that particular course.

17:14 Here, we can see the names of the lessons

17:16 and if we would like, we can even build additional functionality

17:20 to get sources for each one of those.

17:22 In the next lesson, we'll talk about what happens

17:25 when things go wrong and how we can use

17:27 Claude Code to debug, to write tests,

17:29 and make sure that we feel confident in

17:32 the software that we're writing alongside Claude Code.
