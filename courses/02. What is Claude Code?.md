0:02 In this first lesson, we'll go

0:04 through the agentic workflow of Claude Code,

0:06 the tools it uses to navigate your codebase,

0:09 and the memory it keeps across sessions. Let's dive in.

0:12 So let's talk a little bit about what Claude Code actually is.

0:17 When we talk about agentic systems,

0:20 we think a lot about a model, a set of tools,

0:23 and some environment to run those tools.

0:26 Models are great at handling input and returning output.

0:30 But in many situations, those models don't know about your codebase,

0:35 how to find files, and how to handle multiple tasks.

0:39 So instead of just talking directly to a model,

0:41 we're going to provide a very lightweight harness for that model.

0:45 And through the command line, we're going to

0:48 use that harness to leverage the model's intelligence

0:51 to perform complex coding tasks.

0:53 So instead of giving a task directly to the model

0:57 and trying to find all kinds of information in a codebase.

1:00 We're going to provide a set of tools.

1:02 We're going to provide an environment

1:05 and a couple other pieces of functionality

1:08 to enable the model

1:10 to come through codebases and solve much more complex problems.

1:13 What are those pieces of functionality that we're talking about here?

1:16 Enabling the model to have memory,

1:19 enabling our model here to remember preferences of the user

1:23 and the codebase we're going through or the task at hand.

1:27 also going to give the model an environment

1:30 where it can figure out what data it needs,

1:33 formulate a plan and then take action.

1:35 With just a small amount of code,

1:37 we can leverage the model's intelligence to achieve quite remarkable results.

1:42 With Claude Code, your options

1:44 are Opus or Sonnet, depending on the complexity,

1:47 the kind of task you're handling, and your subscription.

1:50 When we talk about what Claude Code can do,

1:53 it's very tempting to just think this is the tool for

1:56 for writing lots of code. But as we progress in this course,

1:59 we're actually going to start with one of the most powerful features

2:03 of Claude Code, which is its ability

2:06 to discover, explain, and design.

2:09 Before you start writing code with Claude Code,

2:12 use it as a way to get

2:14 up to speed on a code base.

2:15 We'll talk quite a bit about writing code with Claude Code,

2:19 but we'll also talk about ways in which you can use it

2:22 outside of the terminal in environments like GitHub. We'll talk a bit

2:25 bit about refactoring, debugging errors

2:28 and where this tool really shines.

2:31 Not only is this useful for coding,

2:33 but also across data analysis and any environment

2:37 where the model's intelligence can create compelling

2:41 visualizations, assets or deliverables for you.

2:44 We mentioned that we give the model a harness.

2:47 We give the model an environment

2:49 to gather context and take an action.

2:52 We talked a bit about the

2:53 memory that we provide to the model.

2:54 And in a little bit, we'll talk

2:56 about what that underlying memory looks like.

2:58 Now, let's talk about the tools

3:01 or additional functionality that we let the model know about.

3:04 To give an illustration of tool use,

3:06 you can imagine that the user asks

3:08 what code is written in a particular file.

3:11 The model does not know how to navigate or

3:14 find files, and that's where tool use comes into play.

3:17 Out of the box, Claude Code

3:19 provides a relatively small list of

3:21 tools. One of those being the ability

3:23 to read a file. Now that the model knows what to do,

3:27 it can go ahead and read that file,

3:29 get the contents of that file,

3:31 and return the data to a user.

3:33 This ability of tool use allows the model to go

3:36 from a simple assistant to an extremely sophisticated agentic tool.

3:40 We mentioned some of the tools

3:42 that Claude Code comes built in with.

3:44 Here is a list of the tools that we have.

3:46 Some of those for editing across different kinds of files.

3:49 Some of those for reading across different files.

3:52 and some for doing additional actions

3:55 like finding patterns,

3:57 searching things across the web,

3:59 and even creating or running sub-agents

4:02 to handle very difficult and challenging tasks.

4:05 Finally, since we're in the command line,

4:07 we're going to need a tool to execute bash or shell commands.

4:12 Tool use is what allows Claude Code

4:15 to gather the context and information that it needs.

4:18 This allows Claude Code to tackle harder problems.

4:21 It also allows Claude Code

4:23 to not have to index your entire code base

4:25 and lead into potential security concerns.

4:28 Finally, Claude Code is quite extensible.

4:30 While you just saw the list of tools

4:32 that Claude Code comes built in with,

4:34 you can also add additional tools

4:36 by connecting to MCP servers.

4:39 MCP, or the model context protocol,

4:42 is an open-source model agnostic protocol

4:44 that allows for data and AI systems to communicate easily.

4:48 These MCP servers can

4:51 add functionality to Claude Code

4:53 for a variety of different tasks

4:55 and we'll explore a few of them over this course.

4:58 I want to take a little more time to

5:00 talk about what we mean by not indexing a codebase.

5:03 Instead of creating a structured representation of the codebase

5:08 and constantly analyzing that,

5:10 Claude Code instead uses a feature called agentic search.

5:13 Instead of requiring that that codebase is sent to a server

5:17 and potentially leaving the ecosystem that you're in,

5:20 Claude Code instead uses

5:22 one or many different agents and sets of tools

5:26 to find what it's looking for in your codebase.

5:29 This allows your code to not

5:31 have to be completely added to context

5:34 or to have to leave the ecosystem that it's in,

5:37 which can create certain security considerations.

5:40 When we talk about the memory of Claude or its ability

5:43 to remember what has happened in previous conversations

5:46 or across all kinds of

5:49 actions. This is done using a markdown file

5:52 called claude.md

5:54 In your claude.md file, you can define common configurations

5:58 or style guidelines.

5:59 These files get automatically loaded

6:02 into context when launched.

6:04 The conversation that you have with claude code

6:07 is stored locally on your machine.

6:09 You can clear that over the course of a conversation,

6:13 so you can start with a new context window.

6:16 But if for some reason, you need to continue

6:18 that previous one or resume the

6:20 earlier conversation, you can do so easily.

6:24 I'm going to head over to the

6:25 terminal that I have inside of VS Code.

6:28 And we can see I have a

6:29 folder here called demo with nothing in it.

6:31 So let's start by opening up Claude Code using the claude command.

6:35 Depending on where this file is, and especially the first time,

6:39 it may ask if I trust the

6:41 files in this folder, which I do.

6:43 We've gotten a couple nice tips here for getting

6:45 started, but I'm just going to start with a very simple prompt.

6:48 Make a cool visualization for me.

6:51 I'm just getting started. What we're

6:52 going to see here is Claude Code

6:54 start to make a to-do list of actions to take.

6:57 You can imagine this task might be to search across a codebase,

7:00 to edit files, to write tests, to deliver insights,

7:04 or in our case to create a visualization.

7:07 Depending on how Claude is feeling,

7:09 this might be particles or fireworks or something else,

7:11 but I just want to show you how quickly

7:13 out of the box you can

7:14 start to see changes with Claude Code.

7:16 Since we're doing this inside of Visual Studio Code

7:19 and Claude Code has an integration with that editor,

7:22 we're going to see visually the changes that are being made.

7:26 I'll accept those and in future editions,

7:28 I'll let Claude Code do that without requesting permission from me.

7:32 We can see here, we have a visualization that's built.

7:35 Let's go ahead and open it in the browser.

7:37 I'll ask Claude Code to do that for

7:39 me. It will confirm. This is the command.

7:40 Let's go see what it looks like.

7:42 And here we are with our visualization.

7:43 Can add some particles.

7:45 lookin' a bit better. You can toggle the animation,

7:48 see what's going on, and clear what we have here.

7:51 We can expand on this as much as we want.

7:53 We can change the functionality, we

7:55 can add whatever we want right here.

7:57 But I just want to show you

7:59 out of the box how seamless it is

8:01 to get up and running with this particular tool.

8:03 In the next lesson, we'll explore how

8:05 to use Claude Code across a larger codebase

8:07 and take a step back and see just how powerful it is

8:10 for explaining larger and more complex code bases.
