0:02 Claude Code has tools for reading and editing Jupyter notebooks.

0:06 In this lesson, we'll go through

0:08 our second example and use Claude Code

0:10 to refactor a Jupyter notebook and transform it into a dashboard.

0:14 Let's get to it. So far we've

0:16 seen how to use Claude Code to

0:17 work with web applications on the front end and back end.

0:20 Now let's shift gears and showcase how to

0:23 use Claude Code to work with a Jupyter notebook.

0:25 I have a Jupyter notebook here

0:27 with some e-commerce data that is fictitious.

0:30 This ecommerce data is reading information from a few CSVs

0:34 that I have in this ecommerce\_data folder.

0:37 I'm using pandas to read data from the CSV.

0:41 I'm displaying some information here, reading some other CSVs,

0:45 and as you can see here,

0:46 I'm getting the answers that I want,

0:48 but this data is not really the most organized.

0:50 I'm getting some statistical information,

0:53 but the formatting and the display might not

0:55 be what I'd like out of the box.

0:57 As I go through and take a

0:58 look at some more of this information.

1:00 I can start to see that I'm beginning to do some more

1:02 complicated procedures here. One of the things that I'd

1:06 like to get out of this data

1:08 are some insights around things like how

1:09 much revenue did we generate year over year.

1:11 Specifically, 2023 to 2022.

1:15 I have the necessary operations here

1:17 to do what I want. In fact, there's a little

1:19 bit of merging between two different CSVs and data frames.

1:22 And here, I'm working my way towards the answer that I want,

1:25 but there are some warnings that I'm seeing here.

1:28 at the same time, it takes a while just to show visually

1:31 what I want and how best to display it.

1:33 So while I do end up getting the numbers that I want,

1:35 it's a little bit tedious and messy. I

1:37 want a way to better showcase this information

1:39 and I want to explore how I can refactor this Jupyter notebook.

1:43 As we see in a few other sections,

1:45 I'm trying to calculate some high level metrics like average order values

1:48 and not only am I looking for

1:50 this number, but this is just for 2023.

1:52 What happens when I want 2024 and so on.

1:55 As we scroll down, we'll see some visualizations

1:58 that are pretty good. But I think we could do better.

2:00 As we work our way towards the

2:01 bottom, we're still calculating more of these

2:03 high level values like sales by state.

2:05 We're generating some visualizations again, but I think we could do

2:08 much better as we start to use tools like Claude Code.

2:11 So with that in mind, let's

2:13 showcase how we can use Claude Code

2:14 to refactor this notebook and better

2:17 consolidate our business logic from our presentation.

2:19 So I'm going to go ahead and open up Claude, and

2:21 I'm going to put in a prompt that I have here

2:23 that references the notebook as well as the other files that

2:27 that I'm working with. I'm going to

2:28 go ahead and paste in this prompt.

2:30 And then I want to talk a

2:31 little bit about what's actually happening here.

2:33 So before I paste in this prompt,

2:35 I'm actually going to make a new markdown file

2:37 just to showcase what this looks like and

2:39 walk through why we've done what we're doing here.

2:42 Notice here, I'm referencing the name of the file using this sign,

2:45 as well as the name of the folder using this as well.

2:48 If you're ever unsure of how best to prompt

2:51 or how best to ask Claude for what to do,

2:54 you can always ask Claude as well. So many

2:56 times, I find myself using tools like Claude AI

2:58 or even Claude Code and just asking

3:00 Claude, here's what I want to do,

3:02 give me the best possible prompt to accomplish this task.

3:06 In our case, we have some Refactoring Requirements

3:09 for how we want the structure to be laid out.

3:11 We have Code Quality Improvements and some asks that we have

3:14 for particular Python files that we want.

3:17 What we're asking Claude to do

3:19 here is create a separate Python file

3:21 for loading our data and processing it.

3:23 And then another Python file for calculating these metrics.

3:27 This separation of concerns is going to allow us to better test

3:30 and better understand what the code is that's powering

3:34 these visualizations that we make in our refactored notebook.

3:37 We're also asking for improved visualizations.

3:40 We're being a little bit more

3:41 specific with what we mean by that.

3:43 Finally, we want to have a little bit

3:45 more configuration around the data that we're working with.

3:48 In general, it's a good practice to

3:50 let Claude know what you're expecting here.

3:52 So instead of just refactor this, give me

3:55 underlying asset for a refactored notebook.

3:57 Give me a way to document

3:59 my functions and calculate my business metrics.

4:02 and then give me some other important files for the dependencies I'm

4:05 working on, as well as a README explaining how to use this.

4:08 So let's go ahead and copy this and paste it in.

4:11 And you'll notice that after you paste a certain number

4:14 of lines, Claude Code is not going to show you everything.

4:16 to keep things a little bit more concise in the terminal.

4:19 So let's go ahead and run this prompt.

4:21 As we've done with other kinds of tools,

4:23 we're going to be using a slightly different suite of tooling here.

4:26 instead of reading, we're going to be dealing with notebook reading.

4:29 But the same to-do list that we

4:31 saw before, it's going to be executed

4:32 just like we've gotten very accustomed to with Claude Code.

4:36 Here we're using that read notebook.

4:38 We're going to explore those cells, we're going to analyze the structure

4:41 and create the refactored notebook that we expect.

4:44 Once this is done, we should expect

4:45 to see not only some powerful visualizations,

4:48 but also some other files with helper functions

4:51 for loading data, processing data,

4:54 and calculating the business metrics that we need.

5:01 accept the changes to these Python files

5:04 and we'll see that Python is being

5:05 written for us using the right tool.

5:07 We'll then go ahead and write another Python file with metric calculations

5:12 for our eventual data and display. As

5:14 Claude Code is working through these individual tasks,

5:17 we can always examine the files that have been created.

5:20 We can give that a look and

5:22 we can see right out of the box

5:23 this kind of object-oriented approach is much cleaner than

5:27 trying to embed everything directly inside of our notebook.

5:30 We can see the same thing for our business metrics calculation.

5:33 and we can see here, the ability to calculate, passing

5:37 in data frames and returning visualizations and validation of that data.

5:40 Looks like we've created our business metrics,

5:43 and finally, our notebook, our requirements.txt, and soon to be our README.

5:48 So while this is running, let's

5:49 take a look at the refactored notebook.

5:51 Let's go ahead and make sure we can run

5:53 all of these cells as expected.

5:55 Right off the bat, this is

5:56 looking a bit nicer visually for us.

5:58 I see here that it's trying to read

5:59 the prompt, and I'll just let Claude know,

6:01 no need to read the prompt, just finish making the README.

6:04 As I take a look at this notebook, I can

6:06 see right out of the box, this is much, much nicer.

6:08 I'm getting analysis into what data I'm looking at,

6:11 and also some configuration to work with.

6:13 I can specify the years and comparison data

6:15 and even any month if I want as well.

6:17 I'll be using these constants across the notebook.

6:20 Here I can see the data loading that's required

6:22 here are the custom modules that I have from my classes.

6:25 So, as I'm running all of these cells,

6:27 looks like things are pretty good so far.

6:29 But if I scroll down a little bit more, I'll actually see

6:31 that there's an error here. I can see right

6:33 off the bat, the problem here appears to be

6:35 some kind of key error. So I'm going

6:36 to ask Claude to fix that for me.

6:38 I'll say I'm getting KeyError

6:40 when I run a particular cell. I could

6:42 try to have Claude Code figure that out for me,

6:44 but I'm actually going to give Claude Code

6:46 the code that I used so that

6:48 it has a little bit more context.

6:49 Claude Code is going to take a

6:50 look at what needs to be done.

6:51 see what the issue is and make the change for us.

6:54 All right, let's go ahead and run these

6:55 cells now that this changes have been made.

6:56 And let's go make sure that things are looking a bit better.

6:58 You can see here as I scroll down,

7:00 I'm not seeing those errors that I was before.

7:01 And now let's take a look at some

7:03 of the business metrics that it's returning to me.

7:04 Getting nicer displays of summaries, information on customer satisfaction,

7:08 that's a little bit easier to

7:09 work with than what I had before.

7:11 As we shift gears towards our revenue analysis,

7:13 we can start to see clearer values, more displayed information

7:18 and a little bit of work to

7:19 more easily display the data we're working

7:21 with the visualizations appear to be more pleasant looking.

7:24 we can see as we look at category performance,

7:27 we've got some even better tools to

7:29 analyze categories and revenue associated with them.

7:31 As we look at our geographic performance,

7:33 we're seeing a nice visualization by state.

7:35 We can hover over that to get

7:37 even more information on a state-by-state basis.

7:38 As we work our way to the bottom,

7:40 when we take a look at additional delivery analysis,

7:43 things are looking good as expected.

7:45 So we've done a nice job refactoring this notebook

7:48 to more visually display information and separate our concerns.

7:50 But what I'd like to do now is

7:52 move from a notebook to a web-based interface

7:54 with a nice dashboard powered by Streamlit.

7:57 If you're not familiar with Streamlit, it's a Python library

8:00 that's useful for displaying interfaces, particularly dashboards,

8:03 and it's very easy to seamlessly transition

8:06 from notebooks to these Python files.

8:08 So let's go ahead and make

8:09 a new markdown file with our prompt

8:11 that we'll call convert-to-dashboard.md

8:13 And let's walk through what we're going to

8:15 put in here. We're going to ask Claude

8:17 to convert our refactored notebook into a professional

8:20 professional Streamlit dashboard with this exact layout.

8:23 We could start just with this first line,

8:25 but in order to avoid lots of back

8:26 and forth, let's just tell Claude what we want.

8:29 We want a header with a title and filter,

8:31 we want KPIs with cards for revenue,

8:33 growth, toward average order value and total

8:35 orders. And then we want some charts.

8:38 revenue, categories, revenue by state, and a bar chart with satisfaction.

8:42 At the bottom row, we want two cards,

8:44 and we want to be specific for the way

8:46 in which we display our data and render this information.

8:49 So with that in mind, let's

8:50 go ahead and give this a shot.

8:51 Let's migrate from notebooks to visual interfaces using Streamlit.

8:55 We can see that it's created our dashboard,

8:58 and as it's going, we can take

8:59 a look at what's being done here.

9:01 We're importing Streamlit, bringing in pandas,

9:03 bringing in some visualizations including Plotly.

9:06 And then here you can see we're displaying some custom CSS for

9:09 styling, setting up our page configuration.

9:12 Most of this really comes from that st

9:14 object that I have to work with Streamlit. We've updated our requirements.

9:18 txt, and here we're actually going to create a README

9:21 displaying everything that's going on in the dashboard.

9:23 In fact, I'll just tell Claude right now,

9:26 don't make a new README, just modify the one we have.

9:29 In many of these longer plans, it's

9:30 very easy to just let Claude go,

9:32 but sometimes you want to stop the process

9:35 and have it navigate the way that

9:36 you want. Now that we've created this dashboard,

9:38 let's open up a new terminal window to start our server.

9:41 In this terminal window on the left, I'll start the server using

9:44 streamlit run and then the Python file that's going to be

9:48 displayed dashboard.py. We can see here

9:50 that I don't have the Streamlit command.

9:53 So I can see here, in

9:54 order to get everything up and running,

9:56 I need to install these dependencies.

9:57 So let's go ahead and do that.

9:59 I'll run my pip install command,

10:01 install all the necessary dependencies and make sure

10:04 that when the server loads, I don't have

10:06 any issues with the dependencies in this application.

10:08 Once that's done, I'll go ahead and run my server.

10:11 And I'll do that using the streamlit run command.

10:14 So let's go ahead and type in streamlit

10:16 run and the name of our Python file.

10:17 Python file just like it suggests right here.

10:20 Back in the browser, here's what things look like.

10:22 I've got some revenue, I've got some growth.

10:24 As we scroll down a little bit,

10:25 we're definitely going to want to verify

10:27 that these numbers are what we expect.

10:28 And we see that some things are still missing a little bit.

10:32 When we take a look at this

10:33 dashboard, it's a pretty good start, but we

10:34 can see that we're missing a couple things.

10:37 It looks like these cards here are empty

10:39 and actually redundant because we're getting the information that we want.

10:44 At the same time, it's a little difficult to start with 2024.

10:47 because we're not seeing much information year over year.

10:51 So maybe we should ask Claude

10:53 to not only clean up these pieces,

10:55 but also start with a default year of 2023,

10:59 so we can have some slightly nicer visualizations.

11:02 but also make sure we have the ability

11:04 to filter based on the month as well.

11:06 The reason why we'll want to start with 2023

11:09 is because we don't have data for every single month for 2024.

11:14 So as we start to look at

11:15 this, the monthly growth is

11:16 a little bit confusing.

11:19 And the data here, we just don't have yet.

11:22 So let's go make those asks, put them back in Claude.

11:24 This is a good start, but I want to

11:26 implement the following changes.

11:28 Let's go ahead and make a

11:30 new line here and first we'll start

11:32 with making sure the default year is 2023.

11:36 Next, ask Claude to add filters for months as well.

11:40 And then finally, we'll make sure

11:42 to remove the empty card for each.

11:46 So, let's update the code in our dashboard for these particular tasks.

11:48 We'll set the default year to 2023, which looks good.

11:52 And here we'll add some filters for months.

11:53 Now let's update the revenue chart to handle

11:55 the case where we're filtering by a specific month.

11:58 We can see the CSS is changing as well.

12:00 So it looks like this chart container

12:01 should be a little bit cleaner than before.

12:03 Let's go back to the browser, see what things look like.

12:06 We can see that 2023 is

12:07 the default, which is a good start.

12:09 We can also see that those

12:11 empty cards are gone, which is great.

12:13 We'll stop here for now, but you can imagine as you keep

12:15 prompting, you can create more powerful visualizations.

12:18 But in a short period of time, we started with a notebook

12:20 that was a bit disorganized,

12:22 was a little hard to read and understand.

12:25 And we migrated now to a dashboard that we can deploy,

12:28 share with team members and iterate on quickly.

12:31 In the next lesson, we'll build a Next.js application

12:34 and use Claude Code to connect to MCP servers

12:38 for Figma and Playwright to take a mockup and build a

12:42 powerful web application with Claude Code quickly.
