0:02 Welcome to Claude Code, the Highly Agentic Coding Assistant.

0:05 This short course is built in partnership with Anthropic

0:08 and Anthropic's Elie Schoppik is back to share with us

0:11 best practices for how to use Claude Code.

0:13 I'm really excited about this short course.

0:15 Claude Code's my personal favorite coding assistant right now,

0:18 and it has boosted my and many other developers' productivity

0:22 by a large margin. And it is a

0:24 tool with a lot of depth to it.

0:27 And so I want to get together with Anthropic,

0:29 to teach, hopefully the definitive course on

0:32 all of the most important ideas behind

0:35 how to use it in a systematic way.

0:37 Thanks, Andrew. I'm excited to be back

0:39 here and start like you mentioned from explaining

0:41 what the tool is, how it works,

0:43 all the way towards using it in parallel

0:45 with many different tools including Git worktrees and MCP servers.

0:50 What we've seen over the last couple

0:52 years is AI assisted coding has evolved rapidly.

0:54 It started from maybe people asking LLMs occasional coding questions.

0:58 suggestions to then GitHub autocomplete to then,

1:01 your various tools that became

1:03 more and more autonomous.

1:05 And Claude Code, when it was released,

1:08 was definitely a step up in terms of the degree of agency

1:10 or the amount of stuff that the coding assistant

1:13 could do by itself. And so

1:15 I think many people were surprised that

1:17 you could set a task that Claude would work on for

1:20 many minutes or sometimes even more than a few minutes.

1:23 And now there are developers that are orchestrating

1:25 not just a single Claude instance, but even several of them.

1:28 working in parallel on different parts

1:30 of a codebase. But coordinating all this

1:32 has to set the best practices that is not widely known

1:36 and if you have not worked

1:37 with people close to the best practices,

1:39 I think there could be a big uplift

1:41 still for mastering these best practices

1:45 and knowing how they drive that amazing productivity

1:47 that I'm seeing many developers have using Claude Code.

1:50 So as we start to talk about those best practices,

1:53 a key tip for working with Claude Code is providing clear context

1:57 to help Claude code achieve the task you want efficiently.

2:00 This means pointing Claude code to the relevant files,

2:03 clearly describing the features and functionality that you want

2:06 and making sure that you're properly extending

2:09 the capabilities of Claude code

2:11 with MCP servers and other tools in that ecosystem.

2:14 In this course, you'll apply those best practices to three different examples.

2:18 We'll start with a RAG chatbot

2:19 and you'll implement the features from

2:21 the front end to the back end,

2:22 including refactoring code, writing tests,

2:26 and then using the GitHub integration to

2:28 work with pull requests and fixing issues.

2:30 You'll make use of many Claude Code features

2:32 like planning, thinking modes, creating parallel sessions,

2:35 and managing Claude's memory.

2:37 For the second example, we'll shift gears and work with Jupyter notebooks

2:40 to explore e-commerce data.

2:42 We'll refactor notebooks using Claude Code, remove redundant code,

2:46 and create powerful dashboards with web applications.

2:49 Finally, we'll move to create a visual mockup

2:51 based in Figma and use Claude Code,

2:54 the Figma MCP server and a different

2:56 MCP server to import the design,

2:59 iterate, test, and build agentically a powerful front-end application.

3:03 If you're not currently a Claude Code user,

3:05 I think learning this set of

3:08 ideas will give you a meaningful acceleration

3:10 in the way that which you can engineer systems.

3:13 And even if you are a current Claude Code user,

3:15 I think having Ellie share these best practices

3:18 with you in a comprehensive and systematic way,

3:21 will, I hope, leave you with quite a few new things

3:24 you try that will be useful. your work.

3:27 I'd like to thank from DeepLearning.AI, Hawraa Salami,

3:29 who had contributed to this course.

3:32 In the next video, Elie will share

3:35 Claude Code's underlying architecture,

3:37 and you might be surprised by how simple the architecture is.

3:41 Claude Code relies on just a small number of tools to search

3:44 for patterns within your code files,

3:46 to list directories, look at files, do regex.

3:50 It does not rely on semantically embedding

3:52 your code in the code base or transforming it into

3:55 searchable structure. And one of the things that

3:58 I think has made Claude Code effective

3:59 is how it agentically can read through your code

4:03 to take notes in a file called code.md to figure out autonomously

4:08 what is going on your codebase to then

4:10 drive decision-making on how to advance your code.

4:13 That's right. And because of that, and not

4:15 having a need to index the codebase,

4:16 you can ensure the codebase stays local.

4:19 We'll talk about some of the security ramifications with that.

4:22 So let's get started. And I'll see you in the next video.
